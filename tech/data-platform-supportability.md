# Improving Data Platform Supportability: Lineage, Documentation, and Best Practices

## Introduction

Building a scalable data platform is not just about moving data; it also requires *supportability* – the ability to understand and maintain the system easily over time. Right now, our platform has evolved into a complex “rat’s nest” of interdependent data streams and services with no single source of truth for how data flows or how components relate. Unlike a traditional OLTP database (where an enforced schema provides a central map of relationships), our distributed streaming system lacks clear **data lineage** and metadata documentation. This makes troubleshooting and onboarding incredibly difficult. To address this, we need to adopt industry best practices around data governance, lineage tracking, and **“docs as code”** – treating documentation and metadata as first-class citizens alongside our code. We should explore tools (open-source or lightweight internal scripts) and processes to **automate** as much as possible, from generating diagrams of data flows to capturing schema changes. In the sections below, we’ll delve into the specific challenges we face and outline best-practice solutions for each, including how to introduce batch processing capabilities, improve our JSON-based configuration DSL, and implement automated documentation and lineage tracking.

## Challenges in the Current Platform

### 1. Missing Data Lineage & Central Metadata

One core issue is the lack of a **centralized metadata catalog or lineage view**. In our current setup, it’s hard to answer basic questions like: *“Where did this data come from? Which downstream processes does it feed into?”* Because the platform is distributed across many services and topics, no single schema or ERD captures the end-to-end flow. This is *even worse* than an undocumented relational DB because relationships are implicit and spread out. Industry experts emphasize that **data lineage is critical** for a data platform’s governance and trustworthiness. Lineage provides the *“full context”* of data by tracing its origin, transformations, and destinations across systems. It ensures teams can verify data quality and understand the upstream/downstream impacts of any change. Without lineage, when something breaks or a data inconsistency is found, engineers have to guess the upstream sources or downstream consumers, which slows down incident resolution and risk assessment.

Moreover, as our data landscape grows in complexity, capturing lineage becomes *harder* if not addressed early. Many organizations implement a **data catalog** or lineage tool to serve as the central metadata repository, so anyone can lookup an entity (a topic, a schema, a table, etc.) and see how it’s connected to others. This is the principle behind tools like LinkedIn’s DataHub or Apache Atlas – they inventory datasets and show lineage graphs. Such lineage is valuable to different personas: for example, data scientists can trace a metric back to source data to verify its integrity, and engineers can quickly find what upstream data a pipeline depends on. In our case, the absence of a lineage repository means knowledge is siloed in the heads of a few team members. If an engineer leaves, we risk “0 idea how data is being loaded” into various sinks.

Finally, while we do use the AWS Glue **Schema Registry** (analogous to Confluent’s Schema Registry) to manage schema versions, we lack a higher-level map of how those schemas tie into data flows. Adopting schema registries is a **best practice** – schemas act as *data contracts* to ensure producers and consumers agree on data format. This improves data quality and governance by preventing incompatible changes. However, schema management is just one piece; we also need to map *which* services/topics use those schemas and how data moves through the system.

### 2. Stream-Only Architecture vs. Batch Workloads

Our platform was built with a streaming-first mindset (similar to a **Kappa architecture**) – everything is funneled through Kafka topics and stream processors, even jobs that are inherently batch-oriented. This decision not to “engineer for batch” is now showing its downsides. **Naturally batchy workloads (e.g. large periodic backfills or reports)** are awkward to process on Kafka. They may require reading huge volumes from a stream or reprocessing entire topics, which is inefficient and complex to manage. Industry perspectives back this up: pure streaming (Kappa) architectures *struggle with hybrid use cases that require batch processing*. For example, replaying an entire event stream to reprocess historical data can be *very resource-intensive* and costly. Kappa designs excel at real-time low-latency processing, but they lack the optimized batch layer that **Lambda architectures** have for recomputing over large historical datasets. In practice, this means if we ever need to recompute a year’s worth of data or run heavy analytics, our stream-only approach either has to brute-force through the log (impacting the streaming cluster) or we build ad-hoc batch jobs that aren’t well integrated.

Best practices suggest using the right tool for the job: incorporate a **batch processing layer or framework** for those batch workloads instead of forcing everything through Kafka. The classic Lambda architecture separated the real-time stream (speed layer) from a batch layer for exactly this reason – to handle large-scale accurate recomputation. Our current approach resembles a “Kappa” (single pipeline for all data), which simplifies the system initially but **limits scalability for batch**. As noted in one analysis, Kappa’s lack of a batch layer means *historical reprocessing is costly and analytics are challenging*, often requiring offloading data to external systems for complex queries. Modern data architecture trends (sometimes called “unified” or **lakehouse + streaming** approaches) try to bridge this gap by combining streaming with a data lake/warehouse for batch analytics. In our context, the key takeaway is that we likely need to **support both modes**: continue using Kafka for real-time pipelines, but introduce a simpler path for batch jobs (perhaps using AWS Glue/Spark, or an orchestrated batch ETL tool) when appropriate. Not doing so was an architectural misstep that we should correct going forward.

### 3. Complex JSON-based DSL for Configuration

Another major pain point is our configuration-driven design. Our services are Java-based, but much of their behavior is controlled by a custom **JSON DSL (domain-specific language)** in configuration files. Over time, this JSON config has evolved into an *implicit programming layer* of its own – essentially a mini-language for defining pipelines, transformations, and relationships between entities. Unfortunately, this DSL is **underdocumented and lacks tooling**, making development and onboarding hard. Only the core team deeply understands the intricacies, and adding features or troubleshooting config issues is daunting for others. This is a common pitfall when developing internal DSLs: if you don’t *intentionally design* the language and its tooling, you often end up with an esoteric, ad-hoc language that is hard to use. Google’s SRE team notes that many teams accidentally create a Turing-complete “configuration language” by continuously extending JSON/YAML configs with new parameters and conventions – the result is a language that has all the complexity of code but none of the support (no IDE help, no linting, few learning resources).

In our case, the JSON config likely started simple (just static settings), but as we added conditional behaviors, repeated patterns, and more “DSL-like” features, it turned into a full programming layer embedded in JSON. This leads to several issues:

* **Learning Curve and Knowledge Silo**: Engineers outside the core team struggle to grasp the DSL’s syntax and semantics. As an internal language with a *small user base*, there’s no community or StackOverflow posts to consult. New developers can’t easily self-teach this DSL because it’s unique to our company. This slows down feature development and makes us busier with support requests.
* **Lack of Tooling**: Standard JSON is not very expressive for complex logic, and because our DSL’s “grammar” is informal (defined by how our code interprets the JSON), it’s hard to build editors or validators for it. Google SRE calls this out as well: a new config language won’t have IDE support or debuggers unless you invest heavily, and ad-hoc semantics make it *painful to develop custom tools*. We have minimal capacity to polish tooling, so things like schema validation, auto-completion, or simulators for the config are nonexistent.
* **Maintenance Overhead**: Changing the DSL or extending it could introduce backwards compatibility issues or hidden bugs, since there’s no formal specification. Each config file becomes like source code that must be carefully managed. But unlike real code, it doesn’t undergo the same code review rigor or testing, which can lead to subtle errors in production.

In short, our JSON DSL has provided flexibility, but at the cost of **developer experience (DX)** and velocity. It’s effectively a small programming language implemented in JSON, which is far from ideal for complex logic (JSON is “optimized for easy parsing, not human readability or writability”). This is a classic *configuration-as-code* dilemma: treat configurations too simplistically and they grow until they need the features of a programming language – but by then, it’s an “accidental language” lacking the niceties of proper languages. We need to address this by either simplifying the configuration model or improving the DSL’s ergonomics through better tooling and documentation.

### 4. Documentation Gaps and Discoverability

Because of the above challenges (no lineage view, complex DSL, etc.), our **documentation** is insufficient for the team’s needs. The existing docs are likely sparse or quickly outdated, since maintaining them hasn’t been prioritized. A telling symptom we noted is *“in some cases to find the document you’re looking for, you would need to have already solved the problem.”* In other words, the documentation is not organized in a way that helps someone who is in the middle of debugging or designing – it might be incomplete, hard to search, or buried in confluence pages. This defeats the purpose of documentation as a *guide* and turns it into an after-the-fact archive.

Modern best practices treat documentation as part of the development cycle, not an afterthought. In data engineering, clear documentation of pipelines, schemas, and dependencies is essential for **knowledge transfer and troubleshooting**. When a pipeline breaks or a data quality issue arises, well-written docs (e.g. a description of what each job does, what data it expects and produces) are often the first place engineers look. If those docs are missing or out-of-date, time is wasted rediscovering logic or reverse-engineering flows. Our current state suggests we haven’t integrated documentation into our workflow – perhaps due to lack of time (“we don't have capacity to polish it”) or lack of a good system to maintain it.

Another issue is **discoverability**: if documentation is not indexed or centrally accessible, engineers might not even know it exists. It sounds like we have scattered design docs or config notes, but nothing like a one-stop reference site for the platform. This makes troubleshooting very inefficient – you end up digging through code or Slack messages rather than reading a concise doc that explains the component. All of this contributes to a high **support burden** on the core team. Ideally, much of that implicit knowledge should be captured in docs and automated references so that any engineer (even outside the core team) can self-serve information about how things work.

## Industry Best Practices and Solutions

Addressing the above challenges requires a combination of **process changes** and **tooling**. We should aim for solutions that bring immediate clarity (even if modest), and also set us up for long-term maintainability. Importantly, we prefer solutions that can be *automated* or at least maintained as code (since manually updated docs or diagrams tend to go stale). Below, we outline best practices and possible implementations for each problem area:

### A. Implement Data Lineage Tracking and Cataloging

**Establishing a “central place” for data lineage** is a top priority. Industry best practice is to use a **data catalog or lineage tool** that automatically collects metadata about datasets and how they flow through pipelines. This could be a heavy-weight enterprise tool or a lean in-house solution – the key is to start capturing the relationships and making them queryable/visualizable. Some approaches and tools to consider:

* **OpenLineage Standard and Marquez**: OpenLineage is an open standard (by the LFAI & Data Foundation) for collecting lineage metadata. It defines a JSON schema for events that describe datasets, jobs, and how data flows from input to output. Many frameworks (like Apache Spark, Airflow, dbt, Flink, etc.) have integrations to emit OpenLineage events. The project also provides a reference implementation called **Marquez**, which is essentially a metadata server and API to store and query lineage info. Adopting OpenLineage could be a pragmatic way for us to start capturing lineage: we might instrument our Kafka consumers/producers or pipeline code to emit lineage events (e.g. “Job X read from topic A and wrote to topic B at time T”). These events could be published to a Marquez instance or even just logged for later processing. The benefit of using an open standard is interoperability – if later we adopt a tool like Airflow or Spark, they can all report lineage in the same format. In fact, OpenLineage is becoming a **de facto standard** embraced by commercial tools and cloud vendors (e.g., Amazon DataZone’s lineage is OpenLineage-compatible).

* **Data Catalogs (DataHub, OpenMetadata, Egeria)**: An alternative (or complementary) approach is deploying a metadata catalog platform. **DataHub** (open-sourced by LinkedIn) and **OpenMetadata** (by the DataHub’s original creators, now a CNCF project) are popular choices. These systems crawl various sources (databases, Kafka, file storage, etc.) to index metadata and often provide a UI to search data assets. DataHub has basic lineage capabilities (it can show upstream/downstream of a dataset), though lineage depth might be limited. **OpenMetadata** is another all-in-one catalog that includes data lineage visualization and even quality checks. The challenge with these is deployment and integration effort – they often require running services (OpenMetadata can use ElasticSearch, etc.) and possibly connectors (some use Kafka to ingest metadata events). Given our resource constraints, a full-fledged data catalog might be a longer-term goal. However, even a limited rollout (e.g. just cataloging a few critical datasets) could start adding value. Notably, *Apache Atlas* is another lineage/governance tool (more tied to Hadoop ecosystems), and **Egeria** is an open source metadata standard/framework that also supports lineage. Egeria, for example, can listen to Kafka events from data processes to capture lineage information in a hub-and-spoke model. These are powerful but could be overkill initially.

* **AWS Native Options**: Since we are on AWS, we should mention **AWS Glue Data Catalog** and the newer **Amazon DataZone**. AWS Glue Data Catalog is a centralized metadata store mainly for data lake (S3) and table metadata; by itself it doesn’t automatically capture streaming lineage, but it’s a place to register data sources. Amazon DataZone (launched in late 2023) is a data catalog with governance features and can capture lineage across AWS services (it integrates with Glue, Redshift, Athena, etc., and supports OpenLineage events for custom lineage). If adopting an AWS managed service is feasible, DataZone could provide a managed way to document data assets, with less integration work than self-hosting DataHub. It’s worth exploring, though it may still be in early adoption.

* **In-House Lineage Tracking**: If deploying a big tool is not possible immediately, we can **build a smaller-scale lineage solution** ourselves. One approach (as demonstrated in an AWS Big Data Blog) is to use a graph database to store lineage information, and capture events from jobs via lightweight agents. In that blog, they used Apache Spark with an open-source **Spline** agent to automatically collect lineage from Spark ETL jobs, then stored it in Amazon Neptune (graph DB) and built a simple UI. We could do something analogous: for our Kafka streams, we might write a “lineage logger” that records, say, which topic a service reads and which topic(s) it writes. We could log this to a central store each time a job runs or deploys. Over time, we accumulate a graph of relations: *Service X -> Topic Y -> Service Z -> DB table Q*, etc. A graph database like Neptune or Neo4j can store this nicely and answer queries like “what are all downstream consumers of Topic Y?”. Even without a graph DB, a simple **Mermaid diagram** (or a generated site) could visualize these relationships.

* **Visualization**: Once lineage data is collected, providing a visual map is extremely helpful for developers. For example, **Confluent’s Stream Lineage** tool (part of Confluent Cloud) offers a graphical UI of event streams and their relationships. Engineers can get a bird’s-eye view of data flows and zoom in on specific paths, which greatly aids understanding. We don’t have Confluent Cloud, but we can aim to replicate a subset of that functionality. Mermaid.js (diagrams as code) can render **flowcharts or directed graphs** in markdown files. We could generate a Mermaid **flowchart** definition of our entire data pipeline: nodes could be topics, databases, and services; arrows show data movement. This diagram could live in our documentation repo and be updated via script whenever the config changes. The goal is that any team member can open a “Data Lineage Map” page and visually trace how data moves through our platform. It answers the big questions at a glance (which helps newcomers and during debugging).

**How to implement (practically)**: We can start by writing a **Python script (or use AWS SDK and Kafka admin API)** to gather existing metadata:

* Query the AWS Glue Schema Registry for all schemas and their descriptions (this gives us an inventory of data types).
* Use the Kafka Admin API (or AWS MSK APIs) to list all Kafka topics and consumer groups. From consumer group subscriptions, infer which service (consumer) reads which topic. (If our services have identifiable group IDs, we can map those to service names).
* Parse our JSON configuration files to find any explicit definitions of inputs/outputs. For example, the config might list source topics or target sinks for each pipeline. We can extract those.
* Also gather info on any batch jobs or database links configured. If certain jobs read from a database or write to a DB table, include those as nodes as well.

Using this metadata, the script can output a **Mermaid graph definition** (or even a JSON graph that we feed to a visualization library). For example, Mermaid’s syntax can define a directed graph like:

````markdown
```mermaid  
flowchart LR  
    ServiceA --produces--> TopicX;  
    TopicX --consumed by--> ServiceB;  
    ServiceB --writes--> DatabaseTableY;  
````

\`\`\` (imagine this is properly formatted in Markdown)

```
This would produce a diagram showing ServiceA -> TopicX -> ServiceB -> DatabaseTableY. Since GitHub and many docs tools now support Mermaid rendering natively, we can store this diagram in our Git repository. It will **serve as up-to-date documentation** of the relationships. Crucially, because it’s generated by code from live configuration, it’s less likely to become outdated (we could even automate the script to run whenever configs change).

Over time, we might evolve this into a more sophisticated internal tool or adopt an open-source solution as capacity allows. The immediate win is to **illuminate the hidden connections** in our system so engineers don’t have to mentally reconstruct them each time.

### B. Embrace Batch Processing Where Appropriate  
To fix the architectural imbalance, we should explicitly incorporate **batch processing capabilities** into our data platform. Industry best practices suggest using a hybrid approach (when needed) rather than one-size-fits-all. Here are recommendations to achieve this:

- **Introduce a Batch Layer or Framework**: We can leverage existing frameworks like Apache Spark, AWS Glue (which is essentially managed Spark), or Apache Flink in batch mode to handle large-scale or periodic jobs. For example, if we have a daily aggregate or a backfill that we currently push through Kafka in chunks, we might instead use a Spark job that reads the raw data from a source (or from Kafka storage directly using the Kafka connector) and writes the result to the target in one go. This could simplify logic and be more efficient. The *Lambda architecture* pattern (batch + speed layers) might have been seen as complex due to maintaining two pipelines:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}, but we can mitigate that by sharing code where possible (e.g., use the same business logic in a library that both stream and batch jobs call). The key is **not** to abuse the streaming pipeline for tasks better suited to batch.

- **Leverage “Mini-batch” Tools**: If full-on Spark is too heavy to start, we could use something like AWS Batch or even scheduled AWS Lambda functions for certain workloads. For instance, if one service needs to recompute data weekly, an AWS Lambda or Step Function that triggers a computation outside Kafka might be simpler than a continuously running stream job accumulating data for a week.

- **Data Lake/Lakehouse Integration**: Consider storing data in a columnar format (Parquet on S3 or using a lakehouse table format like Iceberg/Delta) for large datasets that need analytical queries or reprocessing. Our streaming data could be continuously appended to S3 (using e.g. Kafka Connect or a small consumer that writes to S3). Then batch jobs or Athena queries can operate on the S3 data for heavy reads, instead of burdening Kafka. This aligns with modern “streaming lakehouse” trends: streaming for real-time, but land the data in a lake for batch analytics. New tech like Apache Paimon or Flink with Iceberg exist to unify stream and batch on the same data:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}, but even a simpler approach of dual-writing to Kafka and S3 can work.

- **Guidance from Kappa vs Lambda**: It’s worth noting that many organizations initially tried pure streaming (Kappa) but later re-introduced batch elements when needed. Kappa simplifies by removing the batch layer, but as noted, it has *limitations for historical or large-scale processing*:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}. Lambda, on the other hand, though more complex, provides *accuracy and completeness via the batch layer* while the speed layer handles real-time updates:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. Our strategy can be pragmatic: keep streaming for what streaming is best at (low-latency event processing, incremental updates) and use batch for what batch is best at (large-scale aggregations, reprocessing, backfills). By doing so, we avoid contorting our streams to do things they aren’t good at, thereby reducing complexity. In hindsight, we likely should have planned for this – but we can course-correct now by **designing a batch workflow for those “batchy” use cases** going forward.

### C. Improve the Configuration DSL and Developer Experience  
We need to make our platform’s configuration more **approachable and maintainable**. Since the JSON DSL is effectively a domain-specific language, we should treat it with the same care as we would an external tool or library. Some steps and best practices to consider:

- **Provide Formal Specification and Validation**: At the very least, define a **JSON Schema** for the config DSL. This will formalize the allowed structure and types of fields. Engineers can then use schema validation to catch mistakes in config files. It also serves as documentation of what keys and values are supported. If our DSL has constructs that a JSON schema can’t easily capture (like certain conditions), that’s a sign it might be too complex for JSON alone. In such cases, documenting those clearly in a reference manual is important.

- **Tooling – Linters, Editors, Tests**: Invest some effort in tooling. Perhaps create a simple CLI tool (or IDE plugin if feasible) that can load a config and at least do static checks or sanity tests (for example, verify references to topics or schemas actually exist, etc.). As Google’s SRE guide notes, a good config system should come with tools for managing the files (linters, formatters, even debuggers) to support engineer productivity:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}. We might not build an IDE from scratch, but we can integrate with VSCode by providing a JSON schema (which VSCode can use to give auto-complete and documentation on hover for JSON files). 

- **Recognize and Simplify “Programmable” Parts**: If our JSON DSL is doing things like iterations, conditional logic, or other programming-like tasks (for example, creating multiple entities with one definition, or embedding expressions in strings), consider moving those into a real programming context. One approach is to use a configuration language that allows abstraction, such as **Jsonnet, Dhall,** or **HOCON** (used by many JVM apps). These allow variables, functions, and includes, which can reduce repetition in configs without becoming a full programming free-for-all. Google SRE specifically mentions Jsonnet as a way to reduce toil in config management by enabling modularity and reuse:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}. Another approach is to allow writing the configuration in a general-purpose language and then generating the JSON. For example, some teams use TypeScript or Python to programmatically build config objects, which are then serialized to JSON for the service to consume:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. This way, developers can use the power of an actual language (loops, constants, type checking via TypeScript, etc.) and still output the JSON that the service expects. It effectively shifts the DSL from JSON into code (treating JSON as a compile target).

- **Document the DSL**: Create a **reference guide** for the configuration DSL as if it were an external API. This should include: explanation of the syntax (with examples), all supported keys/fields (and their meaning), and common patterns (recipes for typical tasks). Also document the pitfalls or “gotchas” that only experienced team members know. Since not everyone has capacity to polish it, perhaps schedule a doc-a-thon or encourage core team members to each contribute a section. Without docs, the DSL will remain arcane. Remember, *“If you’re not intentionally designing a language, it’s unlikely the one you end up with is good”*:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42} – part of that intentional design is providing good documentation to users of the language (in this case, our fellow developers).

- **Consider Future Replacement or Refinement**: Long term, we should evaluate if maintaining our own DSL is providing enough benefit to justify its complexity. There might be open-source frameworks that achieve similar configuration-driven pipelines with better community support. For instance, tools like Apache **NiFi** or **Airflow/Dagster** (for batch workflows) allow building pipelines via config or low-code UI. Adopting one of those might offload the DSL maintenance from us. If we stick with our own, we may even consider moving to a **code-first approach** where pipelines are defined in Java/Python using a fluent API, which might be more familiar to developers than JSON DSL. This is a big decision and not to be done hastily, but it’s worth keeping in mind if the DSL proves to be a continual bottleneck.

The immediate next steps, however, are to tame the existing DSL: introduce tooling and documentation so that it’s *less of a black box*. Engineers should be able to validate and understand a config without tribal knowledge. Improving this will also reduce the support load on the core team, as others can self-service more easily.

### D. Documentation as Code – **Automate Everything Possible**  
To ensure documentation is always up-to-date and easily accessible, we should adopt a **“Docs-as-Code”** philosophy. This means documentation lives in the same version control system as our code, is written in plain text formats (like Markdown or reStructuredText), and is updated via the same processes as code changes (pull requests, reviews, CI). By doing so, we avoid the common pitfalls of traditional docs (becoming outdated, hard to track changes, etc.):contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}. Key practices and how we can implement them:

- **Version Control & Collaboration**: Move our documentation into a Git repository (if it’s not already). This could be the same repo as the code or a dedicated docs repo that the team all has access to. Using Git means every change to docs is tracked. It brings the benefit of peer reviews (just like code reviews) for docs, so inaccuracies or unclear explanations can be caught and fixed collaboratively:contentReference[oaicite:45]{index=45}:contentReference[oaicite:46]{index=46}. It also means docs version can align with code version – if we tag a release of the platform, we can tag the state of documentation that matches that release.

- **Markdown + Mermaid for Diagrams**: We should write docs in Markdown (or a similar format) for simplicity. We can integrate **Mermaid** diagrams directly into Markdown to illustrate architectures, data models, etc. GitHub natively renders Mermaid diagrams in Markdown now, which is extremely useful:contentReference[oaicite:47]{index=47}. For example, we can maintain an architecture overview page with a Mermaid flowchart of the platform (possibly generated as described earlier). Because the diagrams are code (Mermaid text), they can be updated easily and tracked in Git. One data engineer recommended exactly this approach: *“store the ETL documentation in markdown and embed the Mermaid diagrams in it – it's already integrated into GitHub”*:contentReference[oaicite:48]{index=48}. This allows diagrams to live alongside text and stay in sync with changes.

- **Continuous Documentation**: Automate the publishing of docs. For instance, if we have a docs site (could use static site generators like MkDocs, Docusaurus, or just rely on GitHub README style), set up a CI pipeline to regenerate any content (like those lineage diagrams or API docs) and deploy the docs site whenever changes are merged. CI can also run checks – e.g., a linter to ensure all Mermaid diagrams render, or that every code change that impacts an interface is accompanied by a docs update (some teams enforce this via PR templates or CI rules). The goal is to bake documentation updates into the development process, so it evolves with the system rather than lagging behind:contentReference[oaicite:49]{index=49}:contentReference[oaicite:50]{index=50}.

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: To complement technical docs, we can use ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) to log the reasoning behind major decisions (like “why we chose Kafka for X” or “why we built a JSON DSL”). ADRs are typically simple Markdown files that describe a decision, its context, and consequences. Keeping these in Git is helpful for new team members to understand past decisions. A reference is Joel Parker Henderson’s ADR guide:contentReference[oaicite:51]{index=51}, which provides a good template. While this is optional, it’s a lightweight way to document tribal knowledge and could prevent repeating past mistakes.

- **Improving Discoverability**: Even with docs in Git, we must make sure people can *find* the information. Organize the documentation logically (e.g., by topic: **Streaming Pipeline Guide**, **Schema Registry Usage**, **Configuration DSL Reference**, **Operations Runbooks**, etc.). Include a search function if using a static site generator, or at least a well-structured table of contents. Over time, as we add lineage info and pipeline docs, we could implement an internal search tool (even a simple grep or a small web app) to query across all our markdown files for keywords. The idea is to avoid the scenario where answers are hidden in a document no one knows about. By centralizing in GitHub, we already gain GitHub’s search which can scan markdown content.

- **Auto-Generated Reference Docs**: Identify any areas where documentation can be **generated from code or config**. We discussed one such area: generating pipeline diagrams from config. Another example: if we have API endpoints or modules in our Java services, we could use Javadoc or Swagger to generate API docs. Or generate a **data dictionary** from the schema registry (list of all schemas and their fields, maybe pulled from Glue and formatted into a Markdown table). Automating these ensures they are complete and updated. One Reddit commenter suggested an integrated approach: use UML diagrams from code, a data catalog for schema info, lineage services for data flow, and metrics dashboards – and have all these pieces automated so that essentially “zero effort” is needed to keep documentation up to date:contentReference[oaicite:52]{index=52}. While zero effort is idealistic, we should strive for *minimum manual effort*. Computers excel at producing structured documentation; humans excel at writing explanatory documentation. We should use each for what it’s best at.

By treating documentation as code, we align it with our existing DevOps practices. This will significantly improve our platform’s supportability: new engineers can ramp up faster by reading the well-maintained docs, and on-call engineers can resolve incidents faster by consulting up-to-date runbooks and data lineage maps. It moves us from a situation of **“tribal knowledge”** to one of **shared, accessible knowledge**.

### E. Open-Source and Tactical Tools to Leverage  
To implement the above improvements, we can take advantage of various open-source tools (mindful of integration effort) and small tactical scripts/services we build ourselves. Here’s a brief list aligned with our needs:

- **Metadata & Lineage**: 
  - *OpenLineage/Marquez*: As discussed, an open standard + service for lineage. We could deploy Marquez (it’s a lightweight web service with a Postgres DB) and have our jobs report lineage to it. Marquez provides a UI to browse datasets and lineage graph. Integration would require coding emitters in our services (there are client libraries available for Java, Spark, etc.). This could be a medium-effort project but yields a solid lineage backbone.
  - *Apache Atlas / Egeria*: Likely heavy for our scale and require a Hadoop ecosystem or extensive setup – probably not a quick win for us.
  - *DataHub or OpenMetadata*: If we have bandwidth, spinning up one of these could give us a quick UI for search and discovery. **OpenMetadata** in particular is designed as a unified platform (covering catalog, lineage, quality, etc.) and has connectors for many systems. It might require only a PostgreSQL and ElasticSearch backend and could be up and running to catalog Glue, Kafka, etc. One caveat: DataHub historically required Kafka as part of its infra (for pushing metadata events), which might complicate deployment.
  - *Tokern* or *TrueDat*: These are less-known open-source lineage tools (Tokern focuses on SQL lineage, TrueDat is a data governance tool). Possibly not directly applicable to our primarily streaming setup, but worth noting as *specialized options*:contentReference[oaicite:54]{index=54}:contentReference[oaicite:55]{index=55}.
  - *DIY with Neptune/Neo4j*: As mentioned, writing our own lineage capture and storing it in a graph database we control. This is actually quite feasible given our system – the relationships (edges) we want to capture are relatively straightforward (produces, consumes, reads-from, writes-to). With a modest engineering effort, we could have a simple lineage service running. AWS Neptune could be an option (managed graph DB) or just a Neo4j container. Our script can periodically push relationships into the graph. We’d need to build or use a minimal UI to visualize or query (Neptune has a notebook interface, and Neo4j has Neo4j Browser and Bloom for visualizing graphs).

- **Batch Processing**:
  - *Apache Spark (AWS Glue)*: We already are in AWS, so using AWS Glue for any batch ETL jobs would be natural. Glue can integrate with our schema registry and has JDBC connectors, etc. We can use Glue jobs (Spark) for heavy lifting batch tasks and Glue’s scheduler or triggers to run them on schedule or on demand.
  - *Apache Flink*: If we want a single engine that can do both streaming and batch, Flink is an option (a bit heavy to self-manage, but very powerful). Flink’s DataSet API (or now unified DataStream with bounded streams) can handle batch jobs. There’s also **Apache Beam** which allows writing pipelines that can run in streaming or batch mode depending on the runner (Dataflow, Spark, Flink).
  - *Airflow / Dagster / Prefect*: These are orchestration frameworks for batch workflows. Airflow is widely used to schedule and manage batch jobs (including Spark jobs or any Python/SQL scripts). Dagster and Prefect are more modern takes with data awareness and orchestration as code. Introducing one of these could help structure our batch jobs and ensure they are well documented (Dagster, for instance, has an UI that shows pipeline structure and lineage at a high level).

- **DSL/Config Tools**:
  - *Jsonnet*: A JSON superset that allows writing config with variables, functions, etc., then compiling to JSON. Could replace our raw JSON usage while staying in familiar syntax.
  - *Dhall*: A strongly-typed functional configuration language that always evaluates to JSON/YAML. Guarantees termination and safety, which might be overkill but it’s an interesting option if we want rigor.
  - *HOCON (with Typesafe Config)*: If our services are JVM, Apache HOCON (used by Lightbend Config library) is a human-friendly superset of JSON that supports comments, includes, and references. It could make config files more readable and modular.
  - *VSCode JSON Schema integration*: Simply writing a JSON schema for our config and distributing it so that developers’ editors can validate and auto-complete config files is an immediate win.

- **Documentation**:
  - *MkDocs or Docusaurus*: These static site generators can pull markdown from a repo and produce a docs website (with search, navigation, etc.). We could host it on an internal service or even GitHub Pages if public is fine (likely we keep it internal). They have plugins for embedding Mermaid diagrams, content versioning, etc.
  - *Mermaid CLI*: There’s a CLI tool for Mermaid that can generate images from Mermaid definitions. We could integrate it in CI to, say, generate a PNG of the latest pipeline graph and include it in documentation or as an artifact.
  - *Graphviz*: For more complex diagrams or if Mermaid is limiting, Graphviz DOT files can also be generated for graphs. Graphviz can produce visual outputs we might embed in docs. However, Mermaid is usually sufficient and more easily integrated with Markdown.

- **Knowledge Sharing Platforms**:
  - *Stack Overflow for Teams or Slack Integration*: If one issue is that people have to ask the core team frequently, encouraging Q&A in a public forum (internal) can help document common solutions. Stack Overflow for Teams (or even a Slack wiki app) can accumulate answered questions that effectively become living documentation. This is more a process/culture tool than a technical one, but worth mentioning if we see repeated questions.

In deciding on these tools, we should weigh the adoption effort. The question notes that *“big open source tools often take a while to adopt and integrate, we need to be mindful of this.”* So a phased approach is wise: start small (scripts, manual documentation improvements) and iterate. Perhaps initially avoid introducing too many new systems at once. For example, we could immediately begin with docs in Git + Mermaid diagrams (low friction), start capturing simple lineage in a file or spreadsheet (just to gather info), and simultaneously prototype OpenLineage integration on one or two pipelines. Over a few months, we might then have enough metadata to justify a small metadata database or deploying OpenMetadata to store it.

## Actionable Next Steps  

To summarize, here’s a practical game plan drawn from the above insights:

1. **Centralize Documentation in Git:** Create a repository (or folder in an existing repo) for platform documentation. Consolidate any existing docs here in Markdown format. Set up an initial README and structure for key areas (Overview, How-tos, Reference (DSL guide), Data Catalog, etc.). Ensure everyone can contribute to it through pull requests. Begin writing an **overview of the current architecture and data flows**, even if high-level. This provides immediate value as a go-to reference.

2. **Generate a Data Flow Diagram (Mermaid):** Write a script to parse our configurations (and possibly query AWS/Kafka) to map out data relationships. Even if it’s not perfect, produce a first draft **Mermaid flowchart** of our major topics and services. Check this into the docs repo so it renders on GitHub. This visual will be hugely helpful for discussions and onboarding. We will iterate on it to refine accuracy.

3. **Implement “Docs as Code” Practices:** Configure a documentation site or at least leverage GitHub’s markdown viewer. (If time permits, set up MkDocs with Material theme for a polished docs site internally). Importantly, integrate the docs process with CI – e.g., auto-deploy the site on merge, and perhaps run a **link checker** or Markdown linter in CI to keep quality. Encourage the team to update docs alongside code changes (we can make it a habit in code reviews to ask “does this change need a docs update?”).

4. **Plan for Lineage Capture:** Kick off a spike to instrument lineage. For a quick win, maybe manually document one or two critical pipelines as lineage examples (e.g., a table that shows “Job A -> Topic X -> Job B -> Database Y”). In parallel, evaluate OpenLineage integration or use the Kafka consumer group info. If we choose OpenLineage/Marquez, set up a Marquez instance in a sandbox and try sending it metadata from one batch job or Kafka client to see the output. Alternatively, use AWS Glue’s metadata: consider tagging Glue schema entries with the producer/consumer info if possible (Glue Schema Registry might allow annotations). Even a simple CSV of “source -> destination” logged in S3 could be a start. The outcome of this step is a clearer path to **automating lineage**. Within a few weeks we want at least a partial automated lineage map.

5. **Enhance the JSON DSL Situation:** Define and publish the JSON Schema for the config DSL. This will flush out the implicit “grammar” and serve as documentation. Set up validation in our build or deployment process using this schema, so that bad configs are caught early. Simultaneously, begin writing the **DSL Reference Guide** in our docs. Core team members can brain-dump the concepts and then refine. Also, investigate using Jsonnet or a similar tool on a small scale – perhaps for one module’s config – to see if it simplifies things. If it does, plan a gradual migration or at least allow its usage.

6. **Batch Workload Accommodations:** Identify one “batchy” use case that is currently painful in the stream. Design a solution for it using a batch approach – for example, a Glue ETL job or a one-time Spark job to handle a backfill. Use this as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the efficiency of a batch pipeline. Document the pattern for future cases. Additionally, if not already done, implement Kafka topic retention policies or tiered storage such that if we *do* need to replay a large history via Kafka, we have the data and don’t take down the cluster (e.g., offload older segments to S3, etc.). This is more of an ops tweak, but helps mitigate the Kappa downside until batch processes are fully in place.

7. **Foster a Culture of Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:** Encourage Q&A and capturing of knowledge. For example, when a team member solves a non-trivial issue, have them add a short “Troubleshooting” entry in the docs or an internal wiki. Treat documentation contributions as valued work (maybe even make it part of sprint tasks). Over time, this will reduce the scenario of needing to have solved a problem to find its documentation – instead, the solution will be recorded for the next person.

By pursuing these steps, we align with industry best practices around **data governance, developer experience, and DevOps**. We’ll gradually see the “rat’s nest” untangle into a more structured web where each thread is traceable. The combination of **automated lineage diagrams, a searchable catalog of data assets, a well-defined config system, and continuously updated docs** will greatly enhance supportability. Engineers will be able to answer questions like *“What happens to data X after it’s published?”* or *“Which jobs depend on schema Y?”* by consulting our documentation or lineage tool, rather than relying on oral history. New hires will have a onboarding map to follow. 

Crucially, many of these improvements feed into each other: for example, capturing lineage automatically means documentation gets easier (since diagrams can be generated rather than drawn by hand), and treating docs as code means improvements are fast and reviewed just like our software changes:contentReference[oaicite:56]{index=56}:contentReference[oaicite:57]{index=57}. It creates a virtuous cycle of better understanding leading to better software, which in turn is easier to document and maintain.

## Conclusion  
In summary, the key to making our data platform more supportable is to **make the implicit explicit**. We must surface the hidden schema relationships, data flows, and business logic that are currently locked in code and config, and turn them into accessible knowledge. Industry best practices – from implementing data lineage and catalogs, to balancing streaming with batch processing, to treating documentation and configuration with the same rigor as code – provide a blueprint for doing this. By adopting these practices and leveraging both open-source tools and custom automation, we can build a kind of **“living documentation”** for our platform: a single, version-controlled repository where one can find how data moves (lineage diagrams), what the data looks like (schemas/contracts), how to configure new pipelines (DSL guide), and why things are built the way they are (ADR decisions).

This will not happen overnight, but we can start with small, tangible steps like diagramming our current state and writing down tribal knowledge. The payoff is huge: reduced onboarding time, faster troubleshooting, and more **self-service** for engineers (fewer “I have no idea how this works” moments). Our platform will move from a black-box network of streams to a well-lit map of data products and pipelines. In essence, we will be treating our **data platform as a product**, one that is well-documented, governed, and thus sustainable. This investment in supportability is vital for scaling the platform and the team effectively. As one expert succinctly put it, good documentation and metadata are the *institutional memory* of a data platform – without them, we risk fragility and confusion:contentReference[oaicite:58]{index=58}. With them, we empower our engineers and stakeholders to trust and efficiently work with the data. Let’s make this shift by integrating these best practices, automating where possible, and continuously refining the knowledge base of our evolving data platform.
