## 1. Delivery Velocity
Focus on quickly and reliably delivering new features and fixes. Includes CI/CD pipelines, release management, and deployment best practices.

**Key Questions**
- How often can we deploy to production *safely*?
- How much unplanned work is impacting delivery?
- What manual processes/friction is there in the release process?
- How do we manage many codebases with multiple changes and release cycles?
- How long does it take from code commit to production release? (and why?)
- How do we rollback *safely* from a release with issues?
- What validation do we have in place to ensure the system is correct?

---

## 2. Operational Capability
Ensure robust, reliable services with strong monitoring, incident management, and support processes.

**Key Questions**
- How do we quickly detect system issues?
- What kinds of issues or system limitations are we aware of?
- Who is responsible for monitoring, first line fixes and escalation? What process are we following?
- What guarantees do we make to upstream/downstream systems? How are those guarantees formalized?
- How long does it take to resolve detected issues and what tooling do we have in place to facilitate debugging?
- How many incidents are reported by downstream consumers? How is it tracked?
- How do we measure stability?
- How can we provide enough transparency in the system for non-core developers to troubleshoot on their own?
- How quickly do we recover / what are the steps to recover? Do we have known scenarios?

---

## 3. Scalability & Performance
Ensures the platform can handle increased load while maintaining acceptable response times and throughput.

**Key Questions**
- What are the critical performance benchmarks we need to measure?
- How can we isolate the impact of one processing stream from another?
- How effectively do we utilize resources (compute, storage, network)? How do we optimize? (AWS)

---

## 4. Security & Compliance
Keeps the platform secure from vulnerabilities and aligned with relevant regulations or standards.

**Key Questions**
- What data on the platform is subject to regulatory (or other) requirements?
- How do we ensure licensed data is distributed only to entitled users/applications?
- What technical vulnerabilities do we have? (3rd party dependencies)
- What audit mechanisms are in place to ensure data lineage is traceable?

---

## 5. Developer Experience
Aims to reduce friction for developers who build on or contribute to the platform. Covers documentation, tooling, onboarding, and overall developer satisfaction.

**Key Questions**
- How quickly can new developers onboard and make a production commit/change?
- How many issues or tickets arise due to unclear documentation or missing tooling?
- Can developers easily run and test platform services locally? (should they even be doing that?)
- How can we measure ease-of-adoption?

---

## 6. Infrastructure & Cost Optimization
Focuses on resource efficiency and using the appropriate infrastructure.

**Key Questions**
- How do we measure the cost associated with onboarding a data source?
- Do we regularly identify and decommission underutilized data?
- How effectively do we track and optimize resource usage (CPU, memory, storage)?

---

## 7. Data Quality and Usage
Covers data pipelines, data integrity, and the ability to generate and act on insights.

**Key Questions**
- How quickly and accurately do we detect data quality or consistency issues?
- What guarantees do we make about the data? (SLAâ€™s, policies for missing daily upstream feeds, vendor agreements)
- Do we have real-time visibility into key metrics (data usage, performance, etc.)?
- What tooling do we have in place to debug data quality issues?

---

## 8. Platform Integration
Ensures external or internal teams can easily build on the platform via APIs and data integrations.

**Key Questions**
- How quickly can XYZ Apps use XYZ Data?
- How quickly can new data be onboarded?
- How can people find the data they are looking for?

---

## 9. Tech-Debt, Renewal & Remediation
Identify, prioritize and remediate high impact tech debt and prevent further accumulation.

**Key Questions**
- How do we track and measure tech-debt?
- Can we measure reduction in open tech debt items over time?
- Can we improve developer efficiency, improved lead time for onboarding datasets, etc.?
- Are there repeated incidents and problems that need to be addressed?
- Are we consistently evaluating and addressing tech-debt in each sprint?
