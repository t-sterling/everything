Creating a **common vocabulary** for discussing data platforms is critical for alignment between engineers, architects, product managers, and stakeholders. Below is a **structured glossary** of key terms categorized by functional domain. This can serve as a **shared language** to describe and reason about modern data platform components, workflows, and governance.

## üí¨ How to Use This Vocabulary

* **For architecture discussions**:
  *‚ÄúThis domain team owns the ingestion and transformation of the Customer data product, which is published to the lakehouse in Iceberg format and documented in DataHub.‚Äù*

* **For platform operations**:
  *‚ÄúWe need lineage visibility from Kafka to dbt to Redshift ‚Äì let‚Äôs integrate OpenLineage and emit events from Airflow.‚Äù*

* **For governance conversations**:
  *‚ÄúAll PII fields must be encrypted and tracked with access controls and audit trails to comply with GDPR.‚Äù*
