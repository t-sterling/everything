Thanks, this is a really thoughtful summary — and you’re absolutely right to pause here.
You're standing at a critical fork:
⚖️ Decision: GitOps vs. Investing in Config-Server
Let’s unpack both paths based on your constraints, and the real underlying problem — many teams editing shared config entities on different timelines, with accidental collisions.
🅰️ GitOps-Based Approach
✅ Pros
You get Git’s battle-tested workflows: branching, PRs, history, diffs, blame, squash merges.
Easier to apply code review and CI checks on config.
Many engineers already understand the workflow.
Git becomes the source of truth, and the database is just a derived cache.
❌ Cons / Challenges
You still need to synchronize Git → DB so services can access config over HTTP.
Sync latency?
Manual errors in sync?
You’ll need some way to enforce release tagging/versioning (e.g., via branches or tags).
You don’t solve the collision problem — in fact, Git makes it more subtle: two PRs can pass review, merge cleanly, and break behavior when promoted together.
Teams now need to manage pull requests for every config change.
Git isn't a database — querying or indexing JSON becomes painful compared to Postgres.
🅱️ Build on the Existing Config-Server
✅ Pros
Already supports HTTP access and versioned JSON config in Postgres.
You can enforce stronger workflows around promotion, like:
Snapshotting config per release (i.e., freeze the world at tag time).
Diff detection across versions.
Conflict detection for concurrent edits.
Much richer querying: introspection, audit views, dynamic filtering.
Potential to build tooling closer to the real config lifecycle instead of adapting Git for the job.
❌ Cons / Risks
You may eventually find yourself rebuilding aspects of Git, even if just simplified (e.g., tracking base versions for edits).
More work to build tooling around collaboration (e.g., locking, merging, blame).
Need good UIs and discipline to support tagging and diffing without Git’s UX.
Requires investment in config governance and review flows (approval gates, CI hooks).
🔍 Key Insight
The root problem isn’t Git vs. DB — it’s team isolation.
As long as multiple teams edit shared entities (config-X) concurrently, and there’s no way to isolate, freeze, or merge changes safely, any system will break down.
🧭 Suggested Direction
Given your needs:
Config served over HTTP
Rich introspection (e.g., JSON views, diffs)
Avoiding accidental promotion
Not wanting to rebuild Git
You’re likely better off investing in your config-server, with a minimal set of “Git-like” behaviors.
🛠️ Features Worth Building (to avoid full Git)
Branching by release (snapshots)
A tag should lock the config version across all relevant entities.
Make edits against a copy/snapshot.
Merge/Conflict Awareness
Detect when two releases are modifying the same entity based on base version.
Prevent promoting if there’s a drift (like a 3-way merge base check).
Config Diff Viewer
Show before/after JSON side-by-side for each release or tag.
Read-only audit trail per config entity
Essentially a lightweight git log or git blame.
Promotion pipeline with dry-run diff
Let teams preview what will change before applying a promotion.
Approval workflows or gates
Especially useful if you adopt a release manager model.
💡 Optional: Hybrid Model?
If you still want Git visibility for certain users:
Export release snapshots to a Git repo after tagging.
That repo becomes an audit trail, not the source of truth.
Developers can view, diff, and blame in Git, but promotion is managed in config-server.
