## **1. Core Concepts in Jira**

    Issue[Issue] -->|Belongs to| Project[Project];
    Issue -->|Has| Epic[Epics];
    Epic -->|Contains| Story[User Stories];
    Story -->|Can be split into| Task[Tasks];
    Issue -->|Can be| Bug[Bugs];
    Sprint[Sprint] -->|Contains| Issues;
    Roadmap[Roadmap] -->|Tracks progress of| Epics;
    Backlog[Backlog] -->|Contains| Issues;
    Board[Agile Board] -->|Visualizes| Sprint;
```

| Jira Concept | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **Issue** | A generic work item (e.g., story, bug, task). |
| **Project** | A collection of issues managed together. |
| **Epic** | A large work item broken into smaller tasks. |
| **Story** | A user requirement that delivers value. |
| **Task** | A unit of work assigned to a person. |
| **Bug** | A reported defect or issue. |
| **Sprint** | A time-boxed iteration of work in Agile. |
| **Backlog** | A list of issues not yet in a sprint. |
| **Board** | A visual representation of workflow. |
| **Roadmap** | A timeline showing project progress. |

## **2. How Jira Items Relate to Sprints**  

### **2.1 Sprint Workflow**  
```mermaid
graph LR;
    Backlog -->|Prioritize| SprintPlanning[Sprint Planning];
    SprintPlanning -->|Move selected issues| Sprint[Sprint];
    Sprint -->|Work in progress| ActiveDevelopment[Active Development];
    ActiveDevelopment -->|Completed| Done[Done];
```

### **2.2 Steps in Sprint Planning**  
1. **Refine the Backlog** â€“ Ensure prioritized issues are well-defined.  
2. **Sprint Planning** â€“ Move selected issues into the sprint.  
3. **Development & Testing** â€“ Work on issues during the sprint.  
4. **Sprint Review** â€“ Demonstrate completed work.  
5. **Sprint Retrospective** â€“ Reflect and improve for next sprint.

## **3. Managing a Structured Agile Board**  

### **3.1 Board Columns & Workflow**  
```mermaid
graph TD;
    Backlog -->|Selected for Sprint| ToDo[To Do];
    ToDo -->|Assigned & In Progress| InProgress[In Progress];
    InProgress -->|Code Review & Testing| Review[Code Review];
    Review -->|Deployment Ready| Done[Done];
```

### **3.2 Using Swimlanes for Organization**  
- **By Priority** â€“ High, Medium, Low  
- **By Type** â€“ Stories, Bugs, Tasks  
- **By Assignee** â€“ Developer-specific tracking

## **4. Planning a Roadmap in Jira**  

### **4.1 Roadmap Structure**  
```mermaid

    title Project Roadmap
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
    section Phase 1: Planning
    Define Requirements :done, 2024-03-01, 2024-03-10
    Identify Dependencies :active, 2024-03-11, 2024-03-15
    section Phase 2: Development
    Sprint 1 :done, 2024-03-16, 2024-03-30
    Sprint 2 :active, 2024-04-01, 2024-04-15
    Sprint 3 :2024-04-16, 2024-04-30
    section Phase 3: Release & Review
    Final Testing :2024-05-01, 2024-05-10
    Deployment :2024-05-11, 2024-05-15
```

### **4.2 Steps to Create a Jira Roadmap**  
1. **Define Epics** â€“ Break down large work items into smaller stories.  
2. **Set Dependencies** â€“ Link issues that rely on each other.  
3. **Create a Timeline** â€“ Assign start & end dates to epics.  
4. **Track Progress** â€“ Update roadmap as issues are completed.
