## **1. Technical Depth vs. Leadership Balance**  
Many Tech Leads struggle to balance **hands-on coding** vs. **leadership responsibilities**.  

| **Tech Lead Type** | **Where You Fit** |
|--------------------|------------------|
| **The "Architect" Tech Lead** (Strong at system design but not very hands-on.) | ‚ùå You prefer to stay hands-on. |
| **The "Manager" Tech Lead** (More focused on people & process than tech.) | ‚ùå You're more technical and execution-driven. |
| **The "Senior Engineer Tech Lead"** (A strong coder but struggles with leadership.) | ‚ö†Ô∏è You still lean toward execution but recognize the need to lead more. |
| **The "Balanced" Tech Lead** (Technical + delegation + strategy.) | üîÑ You are transitioning in this direction. |

‚û° **Where you stand:**  
You **still default to execution** but recognize that leadership (delegation, strategy) is something to refine. You‚Äôre **better at system design and problem-solving than many Tech Leads**, but you likely **don‚Äôt spend as much time on coaching and cross-team collaboration** as some others.

## **2. Strengths Compared to Other Tech Leads**  
‚úÖ **Analytical & Systems-Oriented** ‚Üí You break down complex problems better than most.  
‚úÖ **Execution-Focused** ‚Üí You get things done and don‚Äôt get stuck in meetings.  
‚úÖ **Structured Thinking** ‚Üí You apply methodologies (RAPID, Strangler Fig, etc.), which many Tech Leads **don‚Äôt** do well.  
‚úÖ **Financial & Strategic Thinking** ‚Üí Many Tech Leads don‚Äôt think about ROI, risk, and long-term planning like you do.

## **3. Potential Gaps Compared to Other Tech Leads**  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Delegation & Team Empowerment** ‚Üí Many senior Tech Leads build stronger teams by **coaching more and doing less themselves**.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Influence Across the Organization** ‚Üí Many strong Tech Leads build relationships with other teams, leadership, and product managers, influencing roadmaps and strategy.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Conflict Resolution & People Skills** ‚Üí You value competence, but some Tech Leads excel in **motivating weaker team members** and getting the best out of them.

## **4. Where You Outperform & Where to Improve**  

| **Area** | **Your Strength** | **Where Others May Be Stronger** | **Improvement Idea** |
|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Tech Strategy** | Strong at designing scalable systems. | Some Tech Leads work more closely with Product & Business teams. | Spend time aligning with business goals. |
| **Execution** | You deliver results quickly & efficiently. | Some focus more on coaching than hands-on work. | Use the checkpoint strategy to reduce hands-on work. |
| **People Leadership** | You have high standards & clear thinking. | Others are better at motivating & mentoring weaker team members. | Experiment with mentoring 1-2 people more actively. |
| **Communication & Influence** | You structure ideas well and prefer efficiency. | Some build strong cross-team networks for influence. | Engage more with senior leadership & product teams. |

## **5. Your Growth Trajectory**
Right now, you're moving from **a Senior Engineer-style Tech Lead (hands-on, high-execution, deep in tech)** to a **Strategic Tech Lead (vision-setting, influencing teams, and guiding architecture rather than implementing everything yourself).**  

‚û° If you **stay hands-on and execution-focused**, you‚Äôll be a **highly effective Principal Engineer/Architect** in the future.  
‚û° If you **develop leadership, influence, and team-building**, you‚Äôll be a **strong Engineering Manager or CTO material** over time.  

**The big question:** **Do you want to go deeper into tech (Principal/Architect) or into leadership (CTO/EM path)?**  

What do you think? Where do you want to focus next?
