# Fennel & Orange Salad  
_A bright, palate-cleansing side that balances rich holiday meals._

## Ingredients
- 2 medium fennel bulbs  
  (trimmed, core removed, thinly sliced)
- 3–4 oranges  
  (Navel or Blood — segmented)
- Extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lemon (for a light squeeze)
- Kosher salt
- Black pepper
- Optional fresh herbs:  
  - Parsley (chopped) **or**  
  - Mint (very small amount, torn)

---

## Prep (Can Do Day Before)
1. Thinly slice fennel using a knife or mandoline.
2. Segment oranges, removing membrane and any seeds.
3. Store fennel and oranges **separately** in airtight containers in the fridge.

---

## Assembly (Day Of — Just Before Serving)
1. Combine fennel and oranges gently in a serving bowl.
2. Dress lightly with:
   - Drizzle of olive oil
   - **Tiny** squeeze of lemon juice
   - Pinch of kosher salt
   - Freshly cracked black pepper
3. Add herbs if using:
   - Parsley → fresh & clean  
   - Mint → **very sparingly** (strong flavor)

## Notes
- No vinegar needed — citrus provides all acidity.
- Keep everything **cold** for maximum crunch and refreshment.
- This salad does **not** go on the plate with mash + gravy — serve on the side for palate resets.
- Best served soon after dressing so the fennel stays crisp.

## Serving
Serve chilled or cool as a refreshing contrast to rich dishes like porchetta.
