_A light, elegant holiday dessert with just the right amount of indulgence._

## Ingredients
- ~18 cream puffs  
  (pre-filled or served with whipped cream)
- Strawberries (sliced or quartered)
- Raspberries (whole)
- Blueberries (whole)
- 1–2 kiwis (peeled, thinly sliced)
- 100% cacao chocolate bar  
  (for fine grating)
- Powdered sugar
- Optional: 2–3 tbsp toasted almond slivers  
  (for added crunch)

## Prep (Earlier in the Day)
1. Wash and dry all berries.
2. Slice strawberries and kiwi.
3. Store fruit separately in containers in the fridge.
4. Toast almond slivers (if using) in a dry pan, cool completely.

## Assembly (Just Before Serving)
1. Arrange cream puffs on a platter.
2. Scatter berries and kiwi naturally around and over the puffs.
3. Grate **a light snowfall** of dark chocolate over the top.  
   - Use a microplane for fine, soft texture.
4. Dust gently with powdered sugar as the final touch.
5. Sprinkle almond slivers sparingly for crunch (optional).

## Notes
- Keep proportions light — fruit is the star with accents of chocolate.
- Powdered sugar must be added **last** so it stays crisp and white.
- If cream puffs aren’t filled, serve whipped cream alongside.

## Serving
Serve immediately after assembly to keep the pastry crisp and fruit vibrant.
