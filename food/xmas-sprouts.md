## Day-Of Cooking Instructions
1. Preheat oven to **425–450°F**.
2. Pat sprouts dry if needed — moisture = steaming, not roasting.
3. Toss with:
   - 2–3 tbsp olive oil
   - pinch of kosher salt
   - freshly cracked black pepper
4. Arrange **cut-side down** on a sheet pan.
5. Roast **25–30 minutes**, until deeply browned on the cut side and just tender inside.
6. While they roast, toast almonds in a dry skillet over medium heat for **2–3 minutes** until golden; cool.
7. Remove sprouts from oven and finish with:
   - Squeeze of fresh lemon juice
   - Lemon zest over top
   - A light snowfall of freshly grated Parmesan
   - Toasted almonds sprinkled sparingly

## Notes
- If sprouts are crowded, split across two pans.
- Convection mode is helpful for extra crisping.
- Taste before adding more salt — Parmesan is salty.
- Bright lemon finish keeps the dish from feeling heavy next to porchetta.

## Serving
Serve immediately while hot and crackly.  
Pairs especially well with rich roasts (like porchetta), creamy mash, and fresh salads.
