# Rolled Pork Belly Porchetta  
_Crispy crackling, tender meat, and simple herbs — the star of the table._

## Ingredients
- ~5 lbs pork belly, skin on (cut into two ~2.5 lb rolls)
- Kosher salt
- Black pepper
- 6–8 cloves garlic (minced)
- Fresh rosemary (2–3 tbsp, finely chopped)
- Fresh thyme (1–2 tbsp)
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Olive oil

---

## Prep (2 Days Before Serving)
1. Lay pork belly **skin-side down**.
2. Make herb paste:
   - Garlic, rosemary, thyme, lemon zest, black pepper, olive oil.
3. Spread paste **only on meat side** (not on the skin).
4. Roll tightly and tie with butcher’s twine every ~1½ inches.
5. Pat skin very dry.
6. Light sprinkle of kosher salt on **skin only**.
7. Place on a rack over a tray, **uncovered in fridge** 48+ hours to dry skin.

*No herbs or oil on skin — dryness = crackling.*

## Tips & Notes
- Pat skin dry **anytime** moisture appears.
- Do **not** add more salt to skin right before roasting — it can draw up surface moisture.
- If crackling lags in a spot → rotate toward heat or switch to convection.
- Pan drippings can be skimmed and a **small amount** used to enrich gravy.
