# Derivatives in Corporate Treasury: Instruments, Applications, and Key Considerations

Every corporate treasury faces financial risks from market factors like interest rates, foreign exchange, and commodity prices. To manage these risks, companies employ derivative instruments that hedge or offset unwanted exposures. This report provides a deep dive into the core hedging derivatives – interest rate swaps, foreign exchange (FX) forwards and options, and commodity swaps – focusing on how U.S. corporates use them in practice. We highlight real-world applications in sectors that Chatham Financial serves (real estate, private equity portfolio companies, energy, infrastructure, and general corporates), compare typical pricing/spreads in bank executions versus advisor-negotiated deals, discuss differences between investment-grade and high-yield use cases, and review key hedge accounting considerations under U.S. GAAP (ASC 815). Illustrative examples and diagrams are included to clarify concepts.

## Core Hedging Instruments and Their Use Cases

Hedging is the practice of reducing a company’s exposure to market fluctuations by using financial contracts (derivatives) as offsets to underlying risks. When structured properly, a derivative’s gains should counteract losses in the exposure (and vice versa), thereby stabilizing outcomes. The main instruments corporates use to lock in or limit prices are: interest rate swaps, FX forwards and options, and commodity swaps (or futures). Below we explain each and how they are applied in typical corporate scenarios.

Interest Rate Swaps (IRS): An interest rate swap is a contract in which two parties exchange interest payment streams (cash flows) over a period of time. In a plain-vanilla fixed–floating swap, a company pays a fixed interest rate to a swap counterparty (usually a bank) and receives a floating rate (e.g. SOFR) in return. This effectively converts a floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate obligation: the received floating-rate cash flow from the swap offsets the floating interest on the debt, leaving the company paying a stable fixed rate overall. Corporates commonly use swaps to hedge interest rate risk on variable-rate debt – protecting against rising rates by locking a fixed rate. For example, a real estate firm with a SOFR + 300 bp construction loan might execute a swap to pay 5% fixed and receive SOFR; this fixes its financing cost around 8% regardless of future rate moves. Conversely, some companies use swaps to add floating exposure (receiving fixed, paying float) if they have mostly fixed-rate debt and prefer some flexibility. Swaps are OTC contracts (over-the-counter), customized to match the notional amount and tenor of the underlying loan or exposure. They are ubiquitous in corporate risk management – among public companies that hedge interest rate risk, 81% of hedging instruments are vanilla interest rate swaps (options and other products make up only 19%), underscoring swaps as the dominant tool for interest rate hedging.

Illustration: Cash flow exchange in a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. The company (swap payer) pays a fixed rate to the bank (swap receiver) and receives a floating rate (e.g. SOFR). This structure transforms the company’s floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate obligation by netting out the variable leg.

Use cases: Interest rate swaps are heavily used in commercial real estate (CRE) finance and infrastructure projects, where loans are often floating-rate. Real estate investors commonly enter pay-fixed swaps to achieve a fixed loan coupon and meet lender requirements for interest rate hedging. Infrastructure and project finance deals similarly use swaps to lock in interest costs over long horizons for predictability. Private equity portfolio companies, especially those with leveraged loans, also utilize swaps to cap interest expense and improve debt service visibility (sponsors and lenders often encourage hedging in volatile rate environments). Investment-grade corporates with large debt programs may engage in swaps for more strategic reasons – e.g. swapping a portion of fixed-rate bond debt to floating to benefit if rates fall, or vice versa. High-grade firms that issue bonds might also use forward-starting swaps or treasury locks to hedge interest rates ahead of debt refinancing. In general corporate settings, any company with variable-rate debt (revolvers, term loans) may use swaps to avoid earnings uncertainty from rate swings. Notably, interest rate caps (options setting a maximum rate) are an alternative for hedging floating debt; caps require an upfront premium but do not create liabilities if rates fall, unlike swaps which can go negative in value and entail breakage costs if ended early. Caps are more common when companies desire flexibility or when lenders (especially for sub-investment-grade borrowers) mandate a cap purchase to ensure the borrower can handle interest payments beyond a certain level. Overall, the interest rate swap remains the workhorse instrument to attain fixed-rate certainty on floating obligations.

Foreign Exchange (FX) Forwards: An FX forward is a contract between a company and a bank to exchange a specified amount of two currencies at a fixed forward rate on a future date. The forward rate is determined by the current spot rate adjusted for the interest rate differential between the two currencies for the forward period. FX forwards are used to hedge currency risk by locking in an exchange rate for future cash flows. For example, a U.S. company expecting to receive EUR 2 million in sales revenue in 12 months might sell EUR forward for USD at a rate of 0.90 USD/EUR today to protect its dollar-equivalent income. In 12 months, regardless of where the EUR/USD spot rate moves, the company exchanges EUR 2M for USD at 0.90, securing predictability. The trade-off is that if the market moves favorably (USD weakens so spot USD/EUR is higher than 0.90), the company cannot benefit beyond the locked rate. FX forwards are tailored in amount and maturity to match the exposure (e.g. timing of a foreign-currency payment or repatriation). They are widely used by corporates with international revenues, costs, or intercompany loans to eliminate short-term earnings volatility from currency moves. A forward locks in a known conversion rate on the hedge date, removing all exchange rate risk for that transaction. Use cases span multinational manufacturers and tech firms hedging foreign sales or expenses, energy and commodity producers locking prices in USD, and private equity funds hedging currency on cross-border acquisitions or divestments. In practice, balance sheet exposures (like foreign-currency receivables or payables) are often hedged with rolling forwards, and forecasted transactions (like an expected overseas sale or dividend) can be layered with forwards as the timing firms up. Many mid-sized and larger U.S. corporates maintain ongoing FX forward programs as part of treasury policy. It’s noted that among public companies, creditworthy (investment-grade) firms hedge FX at much higher rates than high-yield peers (72% vs 48% respectively have FX hedges), reflecting that larger multinationals have more FX exposure and resources to hedge.

FX Options: In contrast to forwards, an FX option gives the buyer the right but not the obligation to exchange currency at a set rate (strike) by a future date. Because of this optionality, the buyer pays an upfront premium (like an insurance premium) for the contract. Options are used when a company wants downside protection but also flexibility to benefit from favorable moves or to cancel if the exposure doesn’t materialize. For example, a U.S. firm bidding on a contract in Europe might buy a EUR put/USD call option to hedge the potential EUR revenue: if they win the deal (exposure real) and the euro weakens, the option protects the USD value; if they lose the deal or the euro strengthens, they can let the option expire and either not spend the premium further or convert at better market rates. Use cases for FX options include hedging highly uncertain cash flows (such as tentative sales or project revenues), protecting budgets while allowing upside, and meeting policy in cases where derivatives that can only be assets (options) are preferred due to credit constraints. The advantages are flexibility and no downside beyond the premium: the company isn’t obliged to transact if the spot rate ends up favorable (the option simply expires worthless, with the premium as the only cost). Additionally, once the premium is paid, the option cannot have a negative fair value – it will never be a liability to the buyer – which means no credit exposure or collateral calls for the company. This is particularly attractive for firms with limited credit lines for derivatives or those unwilling to post margin. The main drawback is the upfront premium expense, which can be significant and thus sometimes deters usage. Still, many corporates judiciously use FX options or zero-cost collars (combining put and call options) for select exposures where flexibility is worth the cost. An example scenario: a real estate fund expecting uncertain euro-denominated property sale proceeds might use FX options to hedge a portion, since the timing and amount could change – the option can be unwound early if the sale closes at a different date, recouping any remaining option value. Overall, Chatham Financial often helps clients evaluate forwards vs. options – balancing certainty versus flexibility – and implement options when they fit the company’s goals and risk appetite.

Commodity Swaps (and Futures): Commodity swaps are derivative contracts where a fixed price for a commodity is exchanged for floating market prices over a period. These instruments enable companies to lock in prices of raw materials or outputs, insulating them from adverse price swings. In a typical commodity swap, one party (often the commodity consumer) pays a fixed price for each unit of commodity, and in return receives a floating payment indexed to market price from the counterparty (often a bank or commodity dealer). This way, if the market price goes above the fixed rate, the consumer receives the difference (offsetting the higher physical cost); if the price falls below fixed, the consumer pays the difference (foregoing the savings). The producer side of the swap does the opposite – effectively guaranteeing a selling price. For example, an airline could enter a jet fuel swap to pay a fixed \$2.50/gallon and receive the market price; if fuel spikes to \$3.00, the swap pays the airline \$0.50 to offset the increased cost, and if fuel drops to \$2.00, the airline pays \$0.50 on the swap (net effectively still \$2.50). Commodity swaps are OTC contracts, customized in volume and tenor (often 6 to 24 months, sometimes several years for energy). Large commodity consumers/producers also use commodity futures traded on exchanges for hedging; these achieve a similar economic effect of locking prices, but futures require daily mark-to-market cash margin posting. In practice, corporates may prefer swaps or structured forwards through banks to avoid daily margin calls (banks often provide OTC hedges with credit lines instead). According to a 2023 study, industries with significant commodity exposure do hedge: 35% of commodity-exposed U.S. corporates (>$5B revenue) hedge their commodity risk. The most active hedgers are natural resource and mining companies, with manufacturing firms being the second-most active (for manufacturing, think of metal prices, plastics, agricultural inputs, etc.). Notably, among commodity hedgers across industries, swaps and futures account for ~67% of hedging products used, far outpacing options (15%). This reflects that most corporates seek to simply lock in prices or margins rather than pay premiums for optionality in commodities (though some do use commodity options or collars if they want to cap prices while retaining upside if prices fall). Use cases: In the energy sector, oil and gas producers regularly use swaps to lock in oil/gas prices for a portion of future production, ensuring cash flow to cover operating costs and debt – for example, an upstream oil producer might swap a fixed Brent crude price for the next 12 months to protect against a price crash. Utilities and independent power producers hedge fuel (natural gas, coal) and electricity prices via swaps or forward contracts to stabilize input costs or revenues. Airlines and transportation companies hedge jet fuel or diesel to manage one of their largest and most volatile expenses (often using swaps or futures on crude oil or refined products). Food & beverage manufacturers hedge agricultural commodities (grains, coffee, sugar) to lock input costs. Even private equity-owned companies will adopt commodity hedging if their industry input costs are volatile (e.g. a PE-owned trucking fleet hedging diesel fuel to better predict its operating costs). In all these cases, the commodity swap converts an uncertain future price into a fixed known price, which can be critical for budgeting and protecting profit margins. One key distinction: commodity swaps are usually cash-settled (no physical delivery; just payment of price differentials). This suits corporates that just want financial protection. For firms preferring no credit exposure, exchange-traded futures can be used, albeit with the liquidity impact of margin calls.

Example: Consider a real-world commodity swap scenario: Company X (a large airline) needs 10 million gallons of jet fuel next year. Fuel currently costs \$2.20/gal. Worried about rising prices, X enters a 12-month swap with Bank Y to pay a fixed \$2.25/gal on 10M gallons and receive the monthly average market price. If actual fuel prices average \$2.50 in a given month, Bank Y pays Company X \$0.25 per gallon on the 833k gallons for that month (offsetting X’s higher physical fuel costs), and if prices average \$2.00, Company X pays Bank Y \$0.25 (effectively netting X’s cost back up to \$2.25). This ensures X’s effective fuel cost is locked at \$2.25. Meanwhile, Bank Y as a dealer might offset its risk by entering an opposite swap or using futures. Through this hedge, the airline has certainty in its fuel expense and can price its tickets accordingly, avoiding margin erosion from a potential fuel spike.

Sector Spotlight: Different industries emphasize different instruments:

Commercial Real Estate: Uses primarily interest rate swaps (or caps) to hedge floating-rate mortgage debt. Real estate borrowers often have to execute swaps with their loan-originating banks (sometimes as a lender requirement for fixed-rate financing). FX and commodity hedging are rare in CRE (unless investing abroad or dealing with energy contracts in properties). Key concern is negotiating fair swap rates in loan deals (discussed further below).

Private Equity Portfolio Companies: These can span many industries. Common hedges include interest rate swaps or caps on leveraged loans (to manage interest expense in LBOs) and FX forwards if the portfolio company has international operations or acquisitions. Because PE-owned companies are often middle-market (sometimes sub-IG credit), they may face higher derivative costs or require credit support; advisors like Chatham often step in to help such clients implement hedges efficiently and navigate documentation. Hedge accounting is also important if the exit strategy involves IPO or financial transparency for sponsors.

Energy Sector: Very active in commodity swaps. Oil and gas producers hedge output (oil, natural gas) with swaps or collars to secure cash flow and capital budgets. Power companies hedge fuel input costs or electricity output prices. Many have formal hedging policies to mitigate commodity price volatility. These firms also use interest rate swaps on project or corporate debt, and if operating internationally, may use FX forwards (though many commodities trade in USD, so FX is secondary). Energy hedging can be complex due to volumetric risk (production volumes uncertain) and credit considerations, so expert advisory is valued.

Infrastructure: This includes project finance for toll roads, airports, power plants, etc. These entities typically utilize interest rate swaps to fix rates on project loans (often required by lenders to ensure stable cash flow coverage). Some infrastructure projects also hedge commodity prices – e.g. a gas-fired power project might hedge natural gas feedstock costs and power prices via swaps or forwards to lock in a margin. Cross-border projects may use FX forwards or cross-currency swaps to manage currency mismatches in revenues vs. debt. The long horizons (10-30 years) in infrastructure hedging require careful structuring (forward curves, credit over time, etc.).

General Corporates: This broad category includes manufacturers, retailers, tech companies, etc. Hedging focus depends on exposure: Multinationals often hedge FX risk (locking in rates for overseas sales, purchases, or repatriations using forwards/options). Commodity-dependent firms (e.g. an auto manufacturer hedging steel/aluminum or a food processor hedging grain) use swaps or exchange-traded futures to stabilize input costs. Interest rate hedging is common if the firm carries variable-rate debt or plans debt issuance (investment-grade corporates sometimes use derivatives to manage the mix of fixed vs floating debt and to lock future financing rates). These companies also tend to be very attuned to hedge accounting impacts, since they report to public shareholders – as a result, a high proportion of them designate derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships to avoid income volatility (discussed later). Notably, a Chatham research report found many large corporates prioritize interest rate and FX hedging and “continued use of swap- and forward-style products”, with a “hyper focus on achieving hedge accounting” to manage financial reporting outcomes.

## Pricing and Execution: Bank Spreads vs Advisor Value

When a corporate executes a derivative with a bank, the price (rate) quoted often includes a spread or markup that compensates the bank for credit risk and profit. Understanding this pricing is crucial. An interest rate swap’s fixed rate, for instance, is composed of two parts: (1) the mid-market swap rate for that tenor, which reflects where a swap between two highly rated banks would trade (essentially the market’s unbiased rate forecast), and (2) a credit charge or dealer spread added on top by the bank. All banks providing swaps to corporates will include such a spread, but its size can vary. For short, low-risk swaps, the charge may be only a few basis points, whereas for longer maturities or weaker credits, it can reach high single digits or even “teens” of basis points (0.10% or more).

Typical spreads: In competitive markets, banks’ mid-market rates for a given structure at a given time are virtually identical (within fractions of a basis point). The differentiator is the credit/markup. For example, consider a commercial real estate borrower with a 7-year SOFR-based loan at roughly SOFR + 2%. The bank’s mid-market swap rate for 7 years might be 2.00%. If the bank offers to swap the loan to a 4.30% fixed rate (all-in), that implies a 30 bp markup over mid (since 2.00% mid + 0.30% spread + 2.00% loan credit spread = 4.30% fixed). On a \$25 million loan, that 30 bps adds roughly \$500,000 in present value cost to the borrower. Notably, U.S. regulations (Dodd-Frank) require swap dealers to disclose the mid-market mark of a swap at execution time, but that may be too late – in this example the borrower might only learn at closing that the bank included 0.30%, when switching providers is impractical. In reality, the bank will justify a portion of this spread as covering its credit risk (the risk the borrower might default on swap obligations if rates move in their favor). Chatham’s modeling of credit valuation adjustment (CVA) suggests that for a borrower of roughly SOFR+200 credit quality, the actual cost to the bank for a 7-year swap might be only 5–10 bps. Anything above that (in our case ~20–25 bps extra) is essentially the bank’s profit and overhead for providing the swap. This illustrates how substantial the markup can be if not negotiated.

Foreign exchange and commodity hedges also embed spreads. An FX forward rate will reflect interest differentials plus a spread the bank adds (often quoted via slightly worse forward points for the client). For major currency pairs and very creditworthy firms, FX forward spreads are typically quite tight (a few “pips”, where 1 pip = 0.0001 in FX rate), but for exotic currencies or less active clients, banks may widen the spread. On FX options, pricing is even more opaque – banks quote a premium based on implied volatility and add a margin to that implied vol. It’s hard for corporates to discern the markup without competitive quotes. Commodity swaps spreads can be significant, especially if the volume is large or the tenor long. Since commodity hedging often involves volatile markets and sometimes high credit exposure (if the commodity moves drastically, the mark-to-market exposure to the corporate can balloon), banks charge for that risk. High-yield companies may see wider commodity hedge spreads or be required to post initial margin to mitigate bank risk.

Advisory firms like Chatham Financial add value by leveling the playing field in derivative pricing. They do so in several ways:

Market Transparency: Advisors continuously monitor live mid-market rates and spreads across many transactions. They can tell a client what the true market level is for a swap or forward, so the client knows if a bank’s quote contains an excessive spread. For instance, Chatham publishes indicative swap rates on its website and encourages clients to understand mid-market benchmarks. Knowing the mid helps the corporate “understand the composition of the rate and the spread being charged by the bank.”.

Competitive Bidding: If the situation allows (e.g. not tied to a single lender), an advisor can run a competitive auction among multiple banks. Corporates with an established banking group often solicit quotes from several dealers for a given hedge. By “asking banks to bid solely on the credit and execution charge and then awarding to the lowest bidder,” companies ensure they get the most efficient price. Even investment-grade treasury teams do this to save a basis point or two and also to allocate “wallet” among relationship banks. Advisors organize these RFQ (request for quote) processes swiftly and anonymously. The result: banks sharpen their pencils on pricing. It’s not uncommon that an uncompetitive initial quote of, say, 20 bps spread can be bargained down to under 10 bps when banks know they are in a competitive lineup. One treasury practitioner noted that for intraday large hedges they might skip multi-bank bidding to avoid signaling to the market, but for most hedges, competitive processes are standard. Chatham’s experience is that injecting competition can save clients several basis points or more on the all-in rate – which, on large notional hedges, translates to meaningful dollar savings.

Negotiating Lender-Required Hedges: In cases like CRE loans where the borrower is effectively required (or limited) to hedge with the lending bank, an advisor still helps by benchmarking and pushing back on the built-in spread. They assist the borrower in “identifying and negotiating a bank’s credit charge” before the term sheet is signed. In the example above, a borrower who knows mid is 2.00% could insist on a cap, say 10 bps, on the swap markup as a condition of the deal. Chatham advocates that clients “discuss the swap credit charge with potential lenders upfront and get it disclosed in the term sheet”. By doing so, the borrower can compare total loan costs across lenders (including hidden swap fees) and avoid nasty surprises at closing. Advisors provide the data and talking points to justify a fair markup (e.g. “your credit cost is only ~7 bps, so 10 bps spread is fair – 30 bps is not”). Even when only one bank can do the swap (due to collateral or relationship constraints), the presence of an independent advisor tends to “bring pricing transparency to the transaction when competition cannot,” routinely saving basis points on the overall loan coupon.

Term Negotiation and Documentation: Beyond the rate, advisors help negotiate other derivative terms that can affect pricing or risk. For instance, the inclusion of credit breaks, optionality, or asymmetric terms can hide costs. Chatham ensures legal documents (ISDA Schedules, Credit Support Annexes) are reviewed so that clients don’t unknowingly accept disadvantageous terms (like wide bid/ask breakage methodology or onerous default triggers). While this is more about risk management than pricing per se, it ultimately can save money (avoiding “backdoor” fees or losses in unfavorable scenarios).

In summary, banks do provide critical hedging products to corporates, but their pricing is not standardized or public. Unlike bond coupons or loan interest margins which are often transparent, “fees on swaps are not publicly disclosed” – this opaqueness means a company might be overpaying without realizing it. Advisors like Chatham act as the client’s advocate, holding banks accountable to market levels. The impact is especially notable for high-yield or less frequent hedgers, who might otherwise face wide spreads. But even investment-grade companies save money: for example, one IG company might consistently get 3–5 bps tighter swap pricing through disciplined bidding and advisor benchmarking – seemingly small, but over a \$500MM swap, 5 bps = \$250k present value saved. Moreover, advisors can help corporates allocate hedging trades among their banks in a balanced way (maintaining relationships) while still achieving good pricing. The NeuGroup treasury forum insights showed that corporates often “spread swaps across a subset of banks” and use a pricing tolerance band to avoid over-concentration, sometimes giving a slightly higher bidder a chance to match or improve. Having an advisor coordinate these practices brings both financial and relationship benefits.

Finally, advisors also ensure post-trade valuation transparency – providing independent valuations so clients can verify that the bank’s marks over time are fair. In essence, the advisory model is about bringing capital markets expertise to corporates as a fiduciary, much like an investment banking advisor on a debt issuance, to get best execution in derivatives. This levels the information asymmetry between banks and corporates. Given Chatham’s scale (executing over \$4.5 billion in hedges per day), they have real-time pulse on the market to help negotiate tighter spreads and better terms for their clients.

## Investment-Grade vs High-Yield Clients: Hedging Practices and Examples

Hedging isn’t one-size-fits-all – a company’s credit profile and ownership (public vs private) can influence its risk management approach. Below we compare how investment-grade (IG) corporates versus high-yield (HY) or private companies tend to use derivatives, including some use case scenarios:

Hedging Participation: Generally, IG companies (often large public firms with ratings BBB and above) are more likely to hedge financial risks than smaller or riskier firms. Survey data confirms this: e.g. nearly 72% of investment-grade companies hedge foreign currency risk, whereas only 48% of high-yield companies do. The pattern is similar for interest rate risk – higher-rated/larger firms more often have formal hedging programs. High-yield and private companies may opt not to hedge due to cost, complexity, or a view that they can tolerate the risk (or pass it through in pricing). In some cases, HY companies face constraints like lack of internal expertise or concerns about derivative losses impacting covenants, which can make them hesitant. That said, when high-yield firms have significant exposures (especially to interest rates or commodities), they do hedge but perhaps in lower proportions or with simpler tools. For instance, a B-rated manufacturing firm with Euro revenues might hedge 50% of its exposure, whereas an AA-rated peer might hedge 90% under a robust policy.

Instruments and Strategies: Both IG and HY corporates use the core instruments, but there are nuances. Investment-grade companies often have access to a wider range of products and can get more favorable terms. They might employ longer-dated hedges (thanks to better credit allowing longer tenors) and more sophisticated strategies (like cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign debt, or option structures like layered collars). For example, a Fortune 500 company can readily do a 5-year EUR/USD forward or a 10-year interest rate swap, whereas a smaller private firm might be limited to 1-2 year tenors unless they post collateral or pay a credit premium. IG companies also frequently layer hedges over time – e.g. hedging 25% of next year’s FX forecast each quarter – and dynamically adjust hedges as market conditions change, backed by a formal risk committee. High-yield or private companies, on the other hand, may stick to more plain vanilla, shorter-term hedges. A private equity-owned firm might hedge interest rates only during the period of a loan’s initial term (say 3-year swap on a 7-year loan, if expecting to refinance or exit early). They might favor cost-effective hedging: for instance, instead of an expensive 3-year diesel fuel swap, a mid-sized logistics company might buy a 1-year swap and then reassess, or use a collar to reduce upfront premium. Additionally, options vs forwards usage can differ – a strong IG corporate with ample credit lines might choose forwards for zero cost, while a lower-rated company without a credit line for derivatives might opt for purchased options (which, after paying premium, carry no further credit risk to the counterparty). This ties back to the earlier point that options are “not credit intensive” and advantageous for firms without sufficient credit capacity for swaps.

Pricing and Execution Differences: As mentioned, investment-grade firms often enjoy tighter spreads on derivatives. Banks compete hard for their business, and these companies may have ISDA agreements with credit support (CSA collateral agreements) that reduce the bank’s credit risk, resulting in minimal spreads. For example, a large A-rated corporate might execute a 5-year interest rate swap with only ~2 bps dealer margin because the swap is under a two-way CSA (meaning any mark-to-market will be collateralized in cash or Treasuries). High-yield companies typically do not have CSA agreements (banks avoid uncollateralized exposure for weaker credits or require onerous terms), so the bank prices in more credit risk. It’s not uncommon for a single-bank hedge with a sub-investment-grade counterparty to include a 10-20 bp markup on a medium-term swap, whereas an IG firm’s comparable markup might be <5 bps. Advisors help both segments: IG firms use advisors to shave off the last few basis points and ensure fairness, while HY firms rely on advisors to even access the market (finding willing counterparties, negotiating credit terms, and sometimes structuring around constraints).

Use Case – Investment-Grade: Example: Global Manufacturing Co. (Rated A-): The company has \$500M of debt, mostly fixed-rate bonds, and \$200M of EBITDA from overseas (EUR, GBP). It has a formal risk management policy to keep 50-75% of foreign earnings hedged 12 months out. Each quarter, the treasury enters FX forwards to sell expected EUR and GBP revenues for USD. Thanks to strong credit, it gets forward quotes just a hair above mid-market (maybe 0.01–0.02% worse than mid). It designates these forwards as cash flow hedges (so that hedge gains/losses hit OCI, not earnings immediately). It also has some floating-rate bank loans which it swapped to fixed via a 3-year swap at a mere 3 bps spread with a top-tier bank, arranged through a competitive bid facilitated by its advisor. Additionally, noticing that interest rates have climbed and expecting potential future declines, the company decides to rebalance its fixed vs floating mix: it executes a \$100M receive-fixed swap (pay floating) on one of its bonds to effectively convert that portion to floating-rate – this is a strategic move to possibly save on interest if rates fall. They apply fair value hedge accounting for this swap so that the bond’s carrying value is adjusted for changes in rates, offsetting the swap in earnings. This nuanced usage of swaps showcases the sophistication an IG corporate can employ. Notably, the company’s hedging ensures that despite currency volatility and interest rate changes, its earnings and interest expense stay close to plan, satisfying management and shareholders.

Use Case – High-Yield/Private: Example: Private Equity-Owned Auto Parts Co. (B rated): The firm was acquired in a leveraged buyout and has a \$150M term loan at SOFR + 5.00%. The sponsor and lending bank want to manage interest risk, but instead of a swap (which would lock in a high all-in rate ~10% and potentially require collateral if the mark-to-market turns in the bank’s favor), they choose an interest rate cap. The company buys a 3-year cap on SOFR at 3.00% strike, paying an upfront premium of \$2M. This cap ensures that if SOFR rises above 3%, the cap pays out to limit the effective rate – essentially capping the loan’s SOFR portion, while below 3% the company benefits from lower rates. The premium is financed as part of the deal. This is a common approach for lower-rated borrowers: caps have no ongoing liabilities (worst case, the cap expires worthless, with the premium sunk). In this scenario, the company avoids having to post collateral or settle swap breakage if they refinance early (since a cap can be left to run or sold if not needed). Separately, this company sources some raw materials from Europe, but historically it did not hedge euro exposure. After facing margin compression from an unfavorable EUR/USD move one year, they decide to hedge at least 50% of their EUR payments 6 months forward. With guidance from an advisor, they execute rolling EUR forwards. Because of the firm’s weaker credit, the bank requires cash margin if the forward goes deeply out of the money (EUR strengthens). The company sizes the hedge so that potential exposure is manageable, and indeed they periodically post small collateral during EUR swings. Over time, management gains comfort that hedging stabilizes their costs. They forego hedge accounting (since as a private company they focus on cash flows, and the forward mark-to-market swings are relatively small and short-term). The result is a smoother cost base, which helps in meeting the sponsor’s EBITDA targets for an eventual sale. This illustrates how a HY private company might approach hedging in a cautious, limited way but still derive important benefits.

In summary, investment-grade corporates typically hedge more extensively and efficiently, leveraging strong credit and internal infrastructure to support complex hedge programs (often with near full hedge accounting). High-yield and private companies hedge more selectively, focusing on the most critical risks (or lender-mandated risks) and often using simpler structures or shorter horizons. The latter rely more on external advisors for execution and accounting support, effectively outsourcing much of the risk management process. Importantly, the gap is narrowing – as tools and advisory services become more accessible, even smaller firms are adopting best practices. Chatham’s 2025 study of public companies noted that even in a volatile 2022–2023 period, many hedging practices remained consistent across companies, big or small, with widespread use of “swap- and forward-style products” and a common focus on risk management fundamentals.

## Hedge Accounting under ASC 815: Key Considerations

Deploying derivatives in a corporate setting brings not only economic impacts but also accounting implications. Under U.S. GAAP, the default treatment for derivatives is mark-to-market through earnings – meaning any change in fair value each period is recorded in the income statement. This can introduce significant P&L volatility, often unrelated to the company’s core operations (since the hedged item’s offsetting change may not be recognized in earnings simultaneously). To avoid this mismatch, companies turn to hedge accounting (ASC 815, formerly FAS 133) which is a special elective accounting treatment. Hedge accounting, if properly applied, allows deferral of derivative gains/losses to align with the timing of the hedged exposure’s earnings impact. In essence, it lets companies neutralize income volatility from hedges and reflect the true intent – risk reduction – in the financial statements.

Some key points and requirements for hedge accounting (ASC 815) include:

Hedge Relationship Types: The two main hedge designations relevant to corporates are cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. In a cash flow hedge, the derivative offsets variability in future cash flows of a forecasted transaction or variable-rate item (e.g. hedging variable interest payments, forecasted foreign revenues, forecasted commodity purchases). Gains or losses on the hedge are initially recorded in OCI (Other Comprehensive Income), a reserve on the balance sheet, rather than in current earnings. They are reclassified into earnings in the period the hedged transaction affects earnings (for instance, when the interest expense is recorded or the forecasted sale occurs), thus matching the hedge impact with the exposure. In a fair value hedge, the derivative offsets changes in the fair value of an existing asset or liability (often fixed-rate debt). Here, the derivative gain/loss is recorded in earnings along with an opposite adjustment to the hedged item’s carrying value, so income statement volatility is offset in real time. Fair value hedges are less common for corporates (used mostly for swapping fixed debt to floating). The majority of corporate hedges are cash flow hedges (and net investment hedges for foreign subsidiaries), which leverage OCI smoothing. In 2023, 87% of companies that hedged interest rate exposure and 93% that hedged FX exposure achieved hedge accounting treatment – an indication of how critical this is for risk-managing firms. By contrast, only 57% of commodity hedgers got hedge accounting, likely due to challenges in forecasting and ineffectiveness (discussed below).

Documentation and Inception Requirements: To elect hedge accounting, a company must formally document the hedging relationship at inception (contemporaneously with entering the hedge). This documentation (often a hedge designation memo) specifies the hedged item, hedging instrument, risk being hedged (e.g. “variability in cash flows due to changes in SOFR interest rates”), how effectiveness will be assessed, and other particulars. You can’t simply declare retroactively that a derivative was a hedge; it must be set up properly from day one. This is a stringent requirement – skipping or being late on documentation can disqualify hedge accounting.

“Highly Effective” Criterion: The hedge must be highly effective in offsetting the designated risk in the hedged item. Historically, this has meant that changes in the derivative’s value should offset 80% to 125% of the changes in the hedged exposure (the 80–125% rule). Companies need to perform an effectiveness assessment initially and on an ongoing basis (at least quarterly) to demonstrate the hedge relationship is and remains highly effective. The accounting standards allow various testing methods (statistical regression, dollar offset, etc.), and since ASU 2017-12 reforms, some hedges (especially plain-vanilla ones) can qualify for simplified approaches. But fundamentally, there should be a reasonable expectation that the derivative will move inversely to the hedged item in a predictable proportion. Common sources of ineffectiveness might be mismatches in timing, underlying index, or notional amounts. For instance, hedging 100% of an exposure when only ~80% actually occurs would cause ineffectiveness because the “extra” hedge portion has nothing to offset (this is called over-hedging, which can immediately break hedge accounting). This is why forecast accuracy is vital.

Hedged Item Requirements: If the hedge is of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge), that transaction must be deemed “probable” to occur (U.S. GAAP threshold for cash flow hedge). “Probable” in GAAP typically means ~75%+ likely. Companies should be careful not to hedge volumes or sales that might not happen – e.g. hedging revenue that is forecast but could fall through. If a forecasted hedged transaction doesn’t occur, the hedge gains/losses that were in OCI must be immediately reclassified to earnings (since the underlying won’t ever occur). This can be a nasty surprise hit to income. To avoid this, companies often hedge conservatively (only the portion highly likely to occur) and may layer hedges as confidence increases. For example, a seasonal business might hedge a smaller portion of expected winter sales in the summer, then hedge more as orders firm up in the fall, ensuring they never over-hedge. Example: A snowblower manufacturer expects EUR 100M sales next winter, but that could vary with weather – they might initially hedge EUR 60M. If demand looks certain to reach that level, they may later hedge another EUR 20M. This way, if sales only hit EUR 80M, they were not over-hedged. For interest rate hedges, the “forecasted transaction” might be the quarterly interest payments on a future debt issuance – companies must have intent (sometimes documented via board approvals of debt plans) to issue that debt to justify hedging it in advance.

Impact on Earnings and OCI: When hedge accounting is achieved, it changes the path of derivative gains and losses. In a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the hedge’s gain/loss goes into OCI. OCI essentially parks the MTM volatility on the balance sheet until the hedged item hits earnings. For instance, if a company has a pay-fixed swap hedging variable interest, and rates fall causing a swap loss, that loss sits in OCI. When the company eventually records lower interest expense on the debt (due to lower rates), it can reclassify a portion of that OCI loss to offset the interest saving – netting to the fixed rate it intended. Thus OCI acts as a timing buffer: “OCI effectively stores MTM changes until the timing of the hedge and hedged item finally align.”. If hedge accounting weren’t used, that swap loss would’ve hit earnings immediately, even though the underlying interest expense reduction happens later – resulting in distorted profits. By using hedge accounting, 87% of interest rate hedging companies in 2023 managed to keep such volatility out of their reported earnings. Any portion of a hedge deemed ineffective (doesn’t offset perfectly) would be recognized in earnings immediately. Fair value hedges operate differently: the derivative MTM goes to earnings each period, but the hedged item’s carrying value is adjusted with an equal and opposite amount to earnings, so net effect is zero (if 100% effective). This way, a fixed-rate bond being hedged by a receive-fixed swap will have its book value marked up or down along with the swap’s MTM, keeping net income stable at just the floating interest cost.

Special Cases and Pitfalls: Certain kinds of exposures cannot be hedge-accounted even if economically hedged. A notable example: forecasted dividends from a foreign sub – while they create FX cash flow risk, dividends are not earnings of the parent (they are equity transactions), so hedging them doesn’t qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. A company can economically hedge such a dividend (that would be a net investment hedge or treated as a hedge of an equity position), but under ASC 815 it wouldn’t get OCI treatment through a CF hedge. Another case: intercompany transactions that eliminate in consolidation – e.g. a U.S. parent paying euros to an EU subsidiary is not an exposure in consolidated earnings (it washes out), so it generally can’t be designated in a hedge relationship. Treasury teams must carefully identify eligible exposures that impact the consolidated financials. This is where advisors often help by reviewing planned hedges for accounting viability.

Implementing hedge accounting can be complex and requires ongoing discipline. Companies often work with hedge accounting specialists (internal or outsourced) to manage documentation, effectiveness testing, and the proper journal entries each quarter. Any break in compliance – say a missed test, a material forecast change, or a documentation gap – could lead to de-designation and immediate earnings impacts. Chatham Financial’s hedge accounting advisory is an example of support available: they help clients navigate the rules, document hedges, and even provide technology to track and perform effectiveness tests. The goal is to ensure risk management strategies align with financial reporting. As Chatham notes, in today’s volatile environment hedge accounting is “critical in aligning risk management strategies with financial reporting requirements”, reducing earnings volatility and providing clearer insight into true economic performance. Given that rules evolve (FASB updates, etc.), having experts or staying educated is important to maximize hedge accounting benefits while staying in compliance.

To put the importance in perspective: if hedge accounting weren’t available, many CFOs would be hesitant to employ derivatives, because the accounting noise could overshadow the economic benefit. Imagine a scenario where a company hedges interest rates and rates drop – the swap might show a large loss one quarter. Without hedge accounting, that loss hits earnings and perhaps confuses investors (“why a \$50MM loss on a swap?”), even though the company will pay less interest going forward (a benefit realized gradually). Hedge accounting bridges that timing gap, so the company’s reported earnings reflect the hedged outcome (steady interest expense) rather than volatile mark-to-market swings. This is why nearly all hedging investment-grade corporates take the trouble to qualify for ASC 815 treatment. Even private companies, while not subject to investor scrutiny, may use hedge accounting to meet lender covenant calculations or simply to better reflect performance in management reports.

In summary, hedge accounting under ASC 815 is a crucial consideration whenever derivatives are used in corporate treasury. Companies should plan hedges in tandem with accounting strategy: define the hedged item/risk clearly, ensure forecasts are reliable, document promptly, and test effectiveness regularly. The effort is rewarded by smoother financial statements that convey the economic stability achieved through hedging. Many organizations engage advisors for this – for instance, Chatham’s hedge accounting team helps dozens of clients with quarterly effectiveness testing, documentation, and even audit support. The result is that management and stakeholders can have confidence that hedging is doing its job without introducing accounting surprises.

## Conclusion and Interview-Ready Takeaways

Hedging with derivatives is a powerful practice for corporates to manage financial risks, but it requires a combination of financial insight, market savvy, and accounting diligence to do successfully. For a well-rounded understanding in a corporate treasury or advisory context (such as Chatham Financial’s business), remember these key points:

Interest Rate Swaps, FX Forwards/Options, and Commodity Swaps are the core hedging instruments for most non-financial companies. Swaps allow exchanging fixed vs floating payments to achieve desired rate or price certainty, forwards lock in future prices/rates, and options provide insurance with flexibility. Mastering how each works and their cash flow profiles is fundamental (e.g. paying fixed/receiving float on a swap to hedge a loan).

Real-world usage varies by industry: Real estate and infrastructure clients concentrate on interest rate hedges for loans; energy and commodities players focus on price hedges (swaps/futures) for their products or inputs; multinationals across sectors emphasize FX hedging to protect earnings and cash flows from currency moves. High-level statistic: most big companies hedge rates and FX, a good number hedge commodities if relevant, and swaps and forwards are far more prevalent than exotic options in these programs.

Bank pricing includes hidden spreads, which can be significant. Without competitive pressure or transparency, corporates may pay a 20-30 bp markup on a derivative trade. Over large notionals, that’s a substantial cost. Independent advisors mitigate this by bringing market transparency and negotiating power, often saving clients meaningful basis points on each trade. Knowing the concept of mid-market vs credit charge and how advisors conduct auctions or lender negotiations is crucial. A good interview talking point is the example of a swap marked up 30 bps (costing \$500k), which an advisor could potentially trim down to ~10 bps by revealing that only 5-10 bps was needed for credit risk.

Investment-grade vs high-yield hedging: IG companies tend to hedge more extensively and get better pricing, whereas HY/private firms hedge selectively and may rely on caps or shorter hedges due to credit constraints. Both benefit from advisory services but in different ways: IG for optimizing and policy support, HY for access, execution, and outsource expertise. Citing the stat that 72% of IG firms hedge FX vs 48% HY, or that nearly all IG hedgers pursue hedge accounting, can demonstrate awareness of these differences.

Hedge accounting (ASC 815) is often the make-or-break for corporate hedging programs. Being able to explain why hedge accounting is used – “to defer derivative MTM swings out of earnings and into OCI until the hedge impact is realized” – shows a deeper understanding. Key terms to know: effectiveness testing (80–125%), documentation, cash flow vs fair value hedge, and the high adoption rates of hedge accounting in practice. Also worth noting: many commodity hedgers struggle with hedge accounting (only 57% success) due to forecast variability, so they sometimes take earnings volatility or use alternative metrics to judge performance. An interview-ready concept is to mention how failing to get hedge accounting could send quarterly earnings on a rollercoaster, defeating the purpose of risk management. Thus, a risk manager’s job is not just to execute hedges but also to align them with accounting rules – a point that would resonate at a firm like Chatham, which offers hedge accounting advisory alongside execution.

Risk management is holistic: Beyond the instruments and accounting, a good practitioner considers the operational and legal aspects – for example, ensuring ISDA agreements don’t introduce unexpected risks (like a swap causing a loan default event), monitoring credit exposure to counterparties, and planning for worst-case scenarios (e.g. swap breakage costs if a loan is repaid early). Mentioning these shows practical awareness.

By covering the above, we combine conceptual clarity (how derivatives work, how hedge accounting works) with applied detail (actual use cases, real pricing spreads, statistics from recent reports). This balanced perspective is exactly what an advisory firm values – the ability to translate financial theory into real-world solutions for clients. Whether discussing why a private equity client might choose a cap over a swap, or how to convince a bank to tighten a swap quote, or how to document a cash flow hedge of forecasted jet fuel purchases – these insights demonstrate readiness to engage in corporate risk management at a professional level.
