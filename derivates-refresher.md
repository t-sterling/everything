# Derivatives in Corporate Treasury: Instruments, Applications, and Key Considerations

Every corporate treasury faces financial risks from market factors like interest rates, foreign exchange, and commodity prices. To manage these risks, companies employ derivative instruments that *hedge* or offset unwanted exposures. This report provides a deep dive into the core hedging derivatives – **interest rate swaps**, **foreign exchange (FX) forwards and options**, and **commodity swaps** – focusing on how U.S. corporates use them in practice. We highlight real-world applications in sectors that Chatham Financial serves (real estate, private equity portfolio companies, energy, infrastructure, and general corporates), compare typical pricing/spreads in bank executions versus advisor-negotiated deals, discuss differences between investment-grade and high-yield use cases, and review key **hedge accounting** considerations under U.S. GAAP (ASC 815). Illustrative examples and diagrams are included to clarify concepts.  

## Core Hedging Instruments and Their Use Cases

**Hedging** is the practice of reducing a company’s exposure to market fluctuations by using financial contracts (derivatives) as offsets to underlying risks. When structured properly, a derivative’s gains should counteract losses in the exposure (and vice versa), thereby stabilizing outcomes. The main instruments corporates use to lock in or limit prices are: **interest rate swaps**, **FX forwards and options**, and **commodity swaps** (or futures). Below we explain each and how they are applied in typical corporate scenarios.

### Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)
An interest rate swap is a contract in which two parties exchange interest payment streams (cash flows) over a period of time. In a **plain-vanilla fixed–floating swap**, a company pays a fixed interest rate to a swap counterparty (usually a bank) and receives a floating rate (e.g. SOFR) in return. This effectively converts a **floating-rate loan** into a fixed-rate obligation: the received floating-rate cash flow from the swap offsets the floating interest on the debt, leaving the company paying a stable fixed rate overall. Corporates commonly use swaps to **hedge interest rate risk** on variable-rate debt – protecting against rising rates by locking a fixed rate.

**Use cases:** Interest rate swaps are heavily used in **commercial real estate (CRE)** finance and **infrastructure projects**, where loans are often floating-rate. Real estate investors commonly enter *pay-fixed swaps* to achieve a fixed loan coupon and meet lender requirements. Infrastructure and project finance deals similarly use swaps to lock in interest costs over long horizons for predictability. **Private equity portfolio companies**, especially those with leveraged loans, also utilize swaps to cap interest expense and improve debt service visibility. **Investment-grade corporates** with large debt programs may engage in swaps for more strategic reasons – e.g. swapping a portion of fixed-rate bond debt to floating to benefit if rates fall, or vice versa.

### Foreign Exchange (FX) Forwards
An FX forward is a contract between a company and a bank to exchange a specified amount of two currencies at a fixed **forward rate** on a future date. The forward rate is determined by the current spot rate adjusted for the interest rate differential between the two currencies for the forward period. FX forwards are used to **hedge currency risk** by locking in an exchange rate for future cash flows. For example, a U.S. company expecting to receive EUR 2 million in sales revenue in 12 months might sell EUR forward for USD at a rate of 0.90 USD/EUR today to protect its dollar-equivalent income.

**FX Options:** In contrast to forwards, an FX option gives the buyer the **right but not the obligation** to exchange currency at a set rate (strike) by a future date. Because of this optionality, the buyer pays an upfront **premium** (like an insurance premium). Options are used when a company wants downside protection *but also flexibility* to benefit from favorable moves or to cancel if the exposure doesn’t materialize.

### Commodity Swaps (and Futures)
Commodity swaps are derivative contracts where a fixed price for a commodity is exchanged for floating market prices over a period. These instruments enable companies to **lock in prices** of raw materials or outputs, insulating them from adverse price swings. In a typical commodity swap, one party (often the commodity **consumer**) pays a fixed price for each unit of commodity, and in return receives a floating payment indexed to market price from the counterparty (often a bank or commodity dealer). 

**Use cases:** In the **energy sector**, oil and gas producers hedge output (oil, natural gas) with swaps or collars to secure cash flow and capital budgets. Utilities and independent power producers hedge fuel (natural gas, coal) and electricity prices via swaps or forward contracts to stabilize input costs or revenues. **Airlines and transportation companies** hedge jet fuel or diesel to manage one of their largest and most volatile expenses. **Food & beverage manufacturers** hedge agricultural commodities (grains, coffee, sugar) to lock input costs.

## Pricing and Execution: Bank Spreads vs Advisor Value
When a corporate executes a derivative with a bank, the **price (rate) quoted often includes a spread or markup** that compensates the bank for credit risk and profit. Understanding this pricing is crucial. An interest rate swap’s fixed rate, for instance, is composed of two parts: **(1) the mid-market swap rate** for that tenor, which reflects where a swap between two highly rated banks would trade, and **(2) a credit charge or dealer spread** added on top by the bank. All banks providing swaps to corporates will include such a spread, but its size can vary.

**Advisory firms like Chatham Financial add value by leveling the playing field in derivative pricing.** They do so in several ways:
- **Market Transparency:** Advisors monitor live mid-market rates and can tell a client what the true market level is for a swap or forward.
- **Competitive Bidding:** Advisors can run a **competitive auction** among multiple banks. Injecting competition can save clients **several basis points or more**.
- **Negotiating Lender-Required Hedges:** In cases where the borrower must hedge with its lending bank, an advisor helps **benchmark and push back** on the built-in spread.
- **Documentation:** Advisors ensure ISDA agreements don’t introduce unexpected costs (like hidden breakage fees).

## Investment-Grade vs High-Yield Clients: Hedging Practices
- **Investment-grade corporates** hedge more extensively, using longer-dated, more sophisticated strategies, often with hedge accounting. They benefit from very tight spreads.
- **High-yield/private companies** hedge selectively, often using shorter tenors or caps (options) instead of swaps to avoid collateral/margin requirements. They face wider spreads and rely more heavily on advisors.

## Hedge Accounting under ASC 815
Under U.S. GAAP, derivatives are marked to market through earnings by default, which creates volatility. **Hedge accounting** (ASC 815) allows companies to defer these mark-to-market swings into *Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)* until the underlying exposure affects earnings.

- **Cash Flow Hedge:** Derivative offsets variability in forecasted cash flows (e.g. floating-rate debt interest, forecast FX revenues). Effective hedge results go to OCI first, then into earnings when the hedged item occurs.
- **Fair Value Hedge:** Derivative offsets changes in fair value of existing items (e.g. fixed-rate debt). Hedge gain/loss goes to earnings along with offsetting change in hedged item’s book value.
- **Requirements:** Must document relationship at inception, designate risk, and test effectiveness (80–125% rule). Forecasted transactions must be “probable.”
- **Importance:** In 2023, **87% of companies that hedged interest rate exposure and 93% that hedged FX exposure achieved hedge accounting** treatment.
